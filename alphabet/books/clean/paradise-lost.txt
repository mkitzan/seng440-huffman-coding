Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of _Eden_, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
Sing Heavnly Muse, that on the secret top
Of _Oreb_, or of _Sinai_, didst inspire
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
In the Beginning how the Heavns and Earth
Rose out of _Chaos_: Or if _Sion_ Hill
Delight thee more, and _Siloas_ Brook that flowd
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th _Aonian_ Mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
Before all Temples th upright heart and pure,
Instruct me, for Thou knowst; Thou from the first
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
And madst it pregnant: What in me is dark
Illumine, what is low raise and support;
That to the highth of this great Argument
I may assert th Eternal Providence,
And justifie the wayes of God to men.

Say first, for Heavn hides nothing from thy view
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause
Movd our Grand Parents in that happy State,
Favourd of Heavn so highly, to fall off
From their Creator, and transgress his Will
For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?
Who first seducd them to that fowl revolt?
Th infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceivd
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride
Had cast him out from Heavn, with all his Host
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,
He trusted to have equald the most High,
If he opposd; and with ambitious aim
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God
Raisd impious War in Heavn and Battel proud
With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power
Hurld headlong flaming from th Ethereal Skie
With hideous ruine and combustion down
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,
Who durst defie th Omnipotent to Arms.
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe
Confounded though immortal: But his doom
Reservd him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessd huge affliction and dismay
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:
At once as far as Angels kenn he views
The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
As one great Furnace flamd, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
Servd only to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all; but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsumd:
Such place Eternal Justice had prepard
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordaind
In utter darkness, and their portion set
As far removd from God and light of Heavn
As from the Center thrice to th utmost Pole.
O how unlike the place from whence they fell!
There the companions of his fall, orewhelmd
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side
One next himself in power, and next in crime,
Long after known in _Palestine_, and namd
_Beelzebub_.  To whom th Arch-Enemy,
And thence in Heavn calld Satan, with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence thus began.

If thou beest he; But O how falln! how changd
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light
Clothd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest
From what highth faln, so much the stronger provd
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict do I repent or change,
Though changd in outward lustre; that fixt mind
And high disdain, from sence of injurd merit,
That with the mightiest raisd me to contend,
And to the fierce contention brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits armd
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power opposd
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heavn,
And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?
That Glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,
Since through experience of this great event
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanct,
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
Who now triumphs, and in th excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heavn.

So spake th Apostate Angel, though in pain,
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:
And him thus answerd soon his bold Compeer.

O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
That led th imbattelld Seraphim to Warr
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
Fearless, endangerd Heavns perpetual King;
And put to proof his high Supremacy,
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
Too well I see and rue the dire event,
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us Heavn, and all this mighty Host
In horrible destruction laid thus low,
As far as Gods and Heavnly Essences
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state
Here swallowd up in endless misery.
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now
Of force believe Almighty, since no less
Then such could hav orepowrd such force as ours)
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
Or do him mightier service as his thralls
By right of Warr, what ere his business be
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
What can it then avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being
To undergo eternal punishment?
Whereto with speedy words th Arch-fiend replyd.

Falln Cherube, to be weak is miserable
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,
To do ought good never will be our task,
But ever to do ill our sole delight,
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist.  If then his Providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
Our labour must be to pervert that end,
And out of good still to find means of evil;
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
His inmost counsels from their destind aim.
But see the angry Victor hath recalld
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the Gates of Heavn: The Sulphurous Hail
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice
Of Heavn receivd us falling, and the Thunder,
Wingd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
Let us not slip th occasion, whether scorn,
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,
The seat of desolation, voyd of light,
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,
And reassembling our afflicted Powers,
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,
How overcome this dire Calamity,
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,
If not what resolution from despare.

Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes
That sparkling blazd, his other Parts besides
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,
_Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warrd on _Jove_,
_Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den
By ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast
_Leviathan_, which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim th Ocean stream:
Him haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam
The Pilot of some small night-founderd Skiff,
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
Chaind on the burning Lake, nor ever thence
Had risn or heavd his head, but that the will
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
Left him at large to his own dark designs,
That with reiterated crimes he might
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
Evil to others, and enragd might see
How all his malice servd but to bring forth
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn
On Man by him seduct, but on himself
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pourd.
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames
Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld
In billows, leave ith midst a horrid Vale.
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land
He lights, if it were Land that ever burnd
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;
And such appeard in hue, as when the force
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill
Torn from _Pelorus_, or the shatterd side
Of thundring _Aetna_, whose combustible
And feweld entrals thence conceiving Fire,
Sublimd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,
And leave a singed bottom all involvd
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole
Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,
Both glorying to have scapt the _Stygian_ flood
As Gods, and by their own recoverd strength,
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.

Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat
That we must change for Heavn, this mournful gloom
For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
What shall be right: fardest from him is best
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings
A mind not to be changd by Place or Time.
The mind is its own place, and in it self
Can make a Heavn of Hell, a Hell of Heavn.
What matter where, if I be still the same,
And what I should be, all but less then hee
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least
We shall be free; th Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heavn.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Th associates and copartners of our loss
Lye thus astonisht on th oblivious Pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
Regaind in Heavn, or what more lost in Hell?

So _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_
Thus answerd.  Leader of those Armies bright,
Which but th Omnipotent none could have foyld,
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge
Of battel when it ragd, in all assaults
Their surest signal, they will soon resume
New courage and revive, though now they lye
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,
As we erewhile, astounded and amazd,
No wonder, falln such a pernicious highth.

He scarce had ceast when the superiour Fiend
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
Behind him cast; the broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
Through Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views
At Evning from the top of _Fesole_,
Or in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands,
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine
Hewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,
He walkt with to support uneasie steps
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
Nathless he so endurd, till on the Beach
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and calld
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intranst
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks
In _Vallombrosa_, where th _Etrurian_ shades
High overarcht imbowr; or scatterd sedge
Afloat, when with fierce Winds _Orion_ armd
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew
_Busiris_ and his _Memphian_ Chivalrie,
VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursud
The Sojourners of _Goshen_, who beheld
From the safe shore their floating Carkases
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
Under amazement of their hideous change.
He calld so loud, that all the hollow Deep
Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,
Warriers, the Flowr of Heavn, once yours, now lost,
If such astonishment as this can sieze
Eternal spirits; or have ye chosn this place
After the toyl of Battel to repose
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heavn?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood
With scatterd Arms and Ensigns, till anon
His swift pursuers from Heavn Gates discern
Th advantage, and descending tread us down
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.
Awake, arise, or be for ever falln.

They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd
Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod
Of _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day
Wavd round the Coast, up calld a pitchy cloud
Of _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind,
That ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung
Like Night, and darkend all the Land of _Nile_:
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell
Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
Till, as a signal givn, th uplifted Spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Thir course, in even ballance down they light
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
A multitude, like which the populous North
Pourd never from her frozen loyns, to pass
_Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
Beneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands.
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
Though of their Names in heavnly Records now
Be no memorial, blotted out and rasd
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
Nor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,
By falsities and lyes the greatest part
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator, and th invisible
Glory of him, that made them, to transform
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adornd
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
And Devils to adore for Deities:
Then were they known to men by various Names,
And various Idols through the Heathen World.
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,
Rousd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods adord
Among the Nations round, and durst abide
_Jehovah_ thundring out of _Sion_, thrond
Between the Cherubim; yea, often placd
Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,
Abominations; and with cursed things
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profand,
And with their darkness durst affront his light.
First _Moloch_, horrid King besmeard with blood
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud
Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire
To his grim Idol.  Him the _Ammonite_
Worshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain,
In _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream
Of utmost _Arnon_.  Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
Of _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build
His Temple right against the Temple of God
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
The pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence
And black _Gehenna_ calld, the Type of Hell.
Next _Chemos_, th obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons,
From _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild
Of Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_
And _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond
The flowry Dale of _Sibma_ clad with Vines,
And _Eleale_ to th _Asphaltick_ Pool.
_Peor_ his other Name, when he enticd
_Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlargd
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove
Of _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate;
Till good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell.
With these came they, who from the bordring flood
Of old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts
_Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names
Of _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male,
These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,
Not tid or manacld with joynt or limb,
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condenst, bright or obscure,
Can execute their aerie purposes,
And works of love or enmity fulfill.
For those the Race of _Israel_ oft forsook
Their living strength, and unfrequented left
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low
Bowd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear
Of despicable foes.  With these in troop
Came _Astoreth_, whom the _Phoenicians_ calld
_Astarte_, Queen of Heavn, with crescent Horns;
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon
_Sidonian_ Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,
In _Sion_ also not unsung, where stood
Her Temple on th offensive Mountain, built
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
Beguild by fair Idolatresses, fell
To Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind,
Whose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allurd
The _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
While smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock
Ran purple to the Sea, supposd with blood
Of _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale
Infected _Sions_ daughters with like heat,
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch
_Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led
His eye survayd the dark Idolatries
Of alienated _Judah_.  Next came one
Who mournd in earnest, when the Captive Ark
Maimd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,
Where he fell flat, and shamd his Worshipers:
_Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high
Reard in _Azotus_, dreaded through the Coast
Of _Palestine_, in _Gath_ and _Ascalon_,
And _Accaron_ and _Gazas_ frontier bounds.
Him followd _Rimmon_, whose delightful Seat
Was fair _Damscus_, on the fertil Banks
Of _Abbana_ and _Pharphar_, lucid streams.
He also against the house of God was bold:
A Leper once he lost and gaind a King,
_Ahaz_ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew
Gods Altar to disparage and displace
For one of _Syrian_ mode, whereon to burn
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods
Whom he had vanquisht. After these appeard
A crew who under Names of old Renown,
_Osiris_, _Isis_, _Orus_ and their Train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abusd
Fanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek
Thir wandring Gods disguisd in brutish forms
Rather then human.  Nor did _Israel_ scape
Th infection when their borrowd Gold composd
The Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King
Doubld that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_,
Likning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,
_Jehovah_, who in one Night when he passd
From _Egypt_ marching, equald with one stroke
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.
_Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
Or Altar smoakd; yet who more oft then hee
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
Turns Atheist, as did _Elys_ Sons, who filld
With lust and violence the house of God.
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,
And injury and outrage: And when Night
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
Of _Belial_, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the Streets of _Sodom_, and that night
In _Gibeah_, when hospitable Dores
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.
These were the prime in order and in might;
The rest were long to tell, though far renownd,
Th _Ionian_ Gods, of _Javans_ Issue held
Gods, yet confest later then Heavn and Earth
Thir boasted Parents; _Titian_ Heavns first born
With his enormous brood, and birthright seisd
By younger _Saturn_, he from mightier _Jove_
His own and _Rheas_ Son like measure found;
So _Jove_ usurping reignd: these first in _Creet_
And _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top
Of cold _Olympus_ ruld the middle Air
Thir highest Heavn; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff,
Or in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds
Of _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old
Fled over _Adria_ to th _Hesperian_ Fields,
And ore the _Celtic_ roamd the utmost Isles.
All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appeard
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
In loss it self; which on his countnance cast
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
Semblance of worth not substance, gently raisd
Their fainted courage, and dispeld their fears.
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claimd
_Azazel_ as his right, a Cherube tall:
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld
Th Imperial Ensign, which full high advanct
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblazd,
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:
At which the universal Host upsent
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
Frighted the Reign of _Chaos_ and old Night.
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
Appeard, and serried Shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move
In perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as raisd
To highth of noblest temper Heros old
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage
Deliberate valour breathd, firm and unmovd
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
With solemn touches, troubld thoughts, and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they
Breathing united force with fixed thought
Movd on in silence to soft Pipes that charmd
Thir painful steps ore the burnt soyle; and now
Advanct in view they stand, a horrid Front
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise
Of Warriers old with orderd Spear and Shield,
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief
Had to impose: He through the armed Files
Darts his experienct eye, and soon traverse
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,
Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength
Glories: For never since created man,
Met such imbodied force, as namd with these
Could merit more then that small infantry
Warrd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood
Of _Phlegra_ with th Heroic Race were joynd
That fought at _Thebs_ and _Ilium_, on each side
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds
In Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son
Begirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights;
And all who since, Baptizd or Infidel
Jousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_,
_Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_,
Or whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore
When _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell
By _Fontarabbia_.  Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observd
Thir dread Commander: he above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost
All her Original brightness, nor appeard
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th excess
Of Glory obscurd: As when the Sun new risn
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds
On half the Nations, and with fear of change
Perplexes Monarchs.  Darknd so, yet shon
Above them all th Arch Angel: but his face
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemnd
For ever now to have their lot in pain,
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerct
Of Heavn, and from Eternal Splendors flung
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,
Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire
Hath scathd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,
With singed top their stately growth though bare
Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepard
To speak; whereat their doubld Ranks they bend
From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round
With all his Peers: attention held them mute.
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last
Words interwove with sighs found out their way.

O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers
Matchless, but with th Almighty, and that strife
Was not inglorious, though th event was dire,
As this place testifies, and this dire change
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth
Of knowledge past or present, could have feard,
How such united force of Gods, how such
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile
Hath emptied Heavn, shall faile to re-ascend
Self-raisd, and repossess their native seat.
For me, be witness all the Host of Heavn,
If counsels different, or danger shund
By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns
Monarch in Heavn, till then as one secure
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,
Consent or custome, and his Regal State
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceald,
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own
So as not either to provoke, or dread
New warr, provokt; our better part remains
To work in close design, by fraud or guile
What force effected not: that he no less
At length from us may find, who overcomes
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heavn that he ere long
Intended to create, and therein plant
A generation, whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th Abysse
Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,
For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr
Open or understood must be resolvd.

He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
Far round illumind hell: highly they ragd
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms
Clashd on their sounding shields the din of war,
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heavn.

There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top
Belchd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,
The work of Sulphur.  Thither wingd with speed
A numerous Brigad hastend.  As when bands
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe armd
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,
Or cast a Rampart.  _Mammon_ led them on,
_Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell
From heavn, for evn in heavn his looks & thoughts
Were always downward bent, admiring more
The riches of Heavns pavement, trodn Gold,
Then aught divine or holy else enjoyd
In vision beatific: by him first
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,
Ransackd the Center, and with impious hands
Rifld the bowels of thir mother Earth
For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew
Opnd into the Hill a spacious wound
And digd out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best
Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those
Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell
Of _Babel_, and the works of _Memphian_ Kings,
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,
And Strength and Art are easily outdone
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour
What in an age they with incessant toyle
And hands innumerable scarce perform
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepard,
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Slucd from the Lake, a second multitude
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,
Severing each kinde, and scumd the Bullion dross:
A third as soon had formd within the ground
A various mould, and from the boyling cells
By strange conveyance filld each hollow nook,
As in an Organ from one blast of wind
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,
Built like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures gravn,
The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not _Babilon_,
Nor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence
Equald in all thir glories, to inshrine
_Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat
Thir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove
In wealth and luxurie.  Th ascending pile
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores
Opning thir brazen foulds discover wide
Within, her ample spaces, ore the smooth
And level pavement: from the arched roof
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed
With Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light
As from a sky.  The hasty multitude
Admiring enterd, and the work some praise
And some the Architect: his hand was known
In Heavn by many a Towred structure high,
Where Scepterd Angels held thir residence,
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.
Nor was his name unheard or unadord
In ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land
Men calld him _Mulciber_; and how he fell
From Heavn, they fabld, thrown by angry _Jove_
Sheer ore the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,
On _Lemnos_ th _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate,
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before; nor aught availd him now
To have built in Heavn high Towrs; nor did he scape
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in hell.
Mean while the winged Haralds by command
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held
At _Pandaemonium_, the high Capital
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons calld
From every and Band squared Regiment
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended: all access was throngd, the Gates
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall
(Though like a coverd field, where Champions bold
Wont ride in armd, and at the Soldans chair
Defid the best of Panim chivalry
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)
Thick swarmd, both on the ground and in the air,
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,
New rubd with Baume, expatiate and confer
Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd
Swarmd and were straitnd; till the Signal givn,
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race
Beyond the _Indian_ Mount, or Faerie Elves,
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side
Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,
Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
Reducd thir shapes immense, and were at large,
Though without number still amidst the Hall
Of that infernal Court.  But far within
And in thir own dimensions like themselves
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
In close recess and secret conclave sat
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seats,
Frequent and full.  After short silence then
And summons read, the great consult began.

      THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK II.

High on a Throne of Royal State, which far
Outshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_,
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
Showrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl & Gold,
Satan exalted sat, by merit raisd
To that bad eminence; and from despair
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
Vain Warr with Heavn, and by success untaught
His proud imaginations thus displaid.

Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heavn,
For since no deep within her gulf can hold
Immortal vigor, though opprest and falln,
I give not Heavn for lost.  From this descent
Celestial vertues rising, will appear
More glorious and more dread then from no fall,
And trust themselves to fear no second fate:
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heavn
Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss
Thus farr at least recoverd, hath much more
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne
Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state
In Heavn, which follows dignity, might draw
Envy from each inferior; but who here
Will envy whom the highest place exposes
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share
Of endless pain? where there is then no good
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there
From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind
Will covet more.  With this advantage then
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,
More then can be in Heavn, we now return
To claim our just inheritance of old,
Surer to prosper then prosperity
Could have assurd us; and by what best way,
Whether of open Warr or covert guile,
We now debate; who can advise, may speak.

He ceasd, and next him _Moloc_, Scepterd King
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
That fought in Heavn; now fiercer by despair:
His trust was with th Eternal to be deemd
Equal in strength, and rather then be less
Card not to be at all; with that care lost
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse
He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.

My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here
Heavns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns
By our delay? no, let us rather choose
Armd with Hell flames and fury all at once
Ore Heavns high Towrs to force resistless way,
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self
Mixt with _Tartarean_ Sulphur, and strange fire,
His own invented Torments.  But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe.
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,
That in our proper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat: descent and fall
To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late
When the fierce Foe hung on our brokn Rear
Insulting, and pursud us through the Deep,
With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sunk thus low?  Th ascent is easie then;
Th event is feard; should we again provoke
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find
To our destruction: if there be in Hell
Fear to be worse destroyd: what can be worse
Then to dwell here, drivn out from bliss, condemnd
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;
Where pain of unextinguishable fire
Must exercise us without hope of end
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge
Inexorably, and the torturing houre
Calls us to Penance?  More destroyd then thus
We should be quite abolisht and expire.
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
His utmost ire? which to the highth enragd,
Will either quite consume us, and reduce
To nothing this essential, happier farr
Then miserable to have eternal being:
Or if our substance be indeed Divine,
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heavn,
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.

He ended frowning, and his look denouncd
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous
To less then Gods.  On th other side up rose
_Belial_, in act more graceful and humane;
A fairer person lost not Heavn; he seemd
For dignity composd and high exploit:
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear
The better reason, to perplex and dash
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleasd the eare,
And with perswasive accent thus began.

I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,
As not behind in hate; if what was urgd
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole success:
When he who most excels in fact of Arms,
In what he counsels and in what excels
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution, as the scope
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heavn are filld
With Armed watch, that render all access
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,
Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise
With blackest Insurrection, to confound
Heavns purest Light, yet our great Enemie
All incorruptible would on his Throne
Sit unpolluted, and th Ethereal mould
Incapable of stain would soon expel
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire
Victorious.  Thus repulsd, our final hope
Is flat despair: we must exasperate
Th Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,
And that must end us, that must be our cure,
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost
In the wide womb of uncreated night,
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
Can give it, or will ever? how he can
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,
Belike through impotence, or unaware,
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,
Reservd and destind to Eternal woe;
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?
What when we fled amain, pursud and strook
With Heavns afflicting Thunder, and besought
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seemd
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay
Chaind on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.
What if the breath that kindld those grim fires
Awakd should blow them into sevenfold rage
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again
His red right hand to plague us? what if all
Her stores were opnd, and this Firmament
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurld
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;
There to converse with everlasting groans,
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.
Warr therefore, open or conceald, alike
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
Views all things at one view? he from heavns highth
All these our motions vain, sees and derides;
Not more Almighty to resist our might
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heavn
Thus trampld, thus expelld to suffer here
Chains & these Torments? better these then worse
By my advice; since fate inevitable
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,
The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust
That so ordains: this was at first resolvd,
If we were wise, against so great a foe
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold
And ventrous, if that fail them, shrink and fear
What yet they know must follow, to endure
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit
His anger, and perhaps thus farr removd
Not mind us not offending, satisfid
With what is punisht; whence these raging fires
Will slackn, if his breath stir not thir flames.
Our purer essence then will overcome
Thir noxious vapour, or enurd not feel,
Or changd at length, and to the place conformd
In temper and in nature, will receive
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,
Besides what hope the never-ending flight
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,
If we procure not to our selves more woe.

Thus _Belial_ with words cloathd in reasons garb
Counseld ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,
Not peace: and after him thus _Mammon_ spake.

Either to disinthrone the King of Heavn
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild
To fickle Chance, and _Chaos_ judge the strife:
The former vain to hope argues as vain
The latter: for what place can be for us
Within Heavns bound, unless Heavns Lord supream
We overpower?  Suppose he should relent
And publish Grace to all, on promise made
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble, and receive
Strict Laws imposd, to celebrate his Throne
With warbld Hymns, and to his Godhead sing
Forct Halleluiahs; while he Lordly sits
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,
Our servile offerings.  This must be our task
In Heavn, this our delight; how wearisom
Eternity so spent in worship paid
To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue
By force impossible, by leave obtaind
Unacceptable, though in Heavn, our state
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek
Our own good from our selves, and from our own
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,
Free, and to none accountable, preferring
Hard liberty before the easie yoke
Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse
We can create, and in what place so ere
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain
Through labour and endurance.  This deep world
Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst
Thick clouds and dark doth Heavns all-ruling Sire
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscurd,
And with the Majesty of darkness round
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar
Mustring thir rage, and Heavn resembles Hell?
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light
Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise
Magnificence; and what can Heavn shew more?
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires
As soft as now severe, our temper changd
Into their temper; which must needs remove
The sensible of pain.  All things invite
To peaceful Counsels, and the settld State
Of order, how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils, with regard
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite
All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.

He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld
Th Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long
Had rousd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay
After the Tempest: Such applause was heard
As _Mammon_ ended, and his Sentence pleasd,
Advising peace: for such another Field
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear
Of Thunder and the Sword of _Michael_
Wrought still within them; and no less desire
To found this nether Empire, which might rise
By pollicy, and long process of time,
In emulation opposite to Heavn.
Which when _Beelzebub_ perceivd, then whom,
_Satan_ except, none higher sat, with grave
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemd
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven
Deliberation sat and publick care;
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood
With _Atlantean_ shoulders fit to bear
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look
Drew audience and attention still as Night
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.

Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heavn,
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now
Must we renounce, and changing stile be calld
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,
And know not that the King of Heavn hath doomd
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt
From Heavns high jurisdiction, in new League
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine
In strictest bondage, though thus far removd,
Under th inevitable curb, reservd
His captive multitude: For he, be sure,
In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part
By our revolt, but over Hell extend
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heavn.
What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?
Warr hath determind us, and foild with loss
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none
Voutsaft or sought; for what peace will be givn
To us enslavd, but custody severe,
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment
Inflicted? and what peace can we return,
But to our power hostility and hate,
Untamd reluctance, and revenge though slow,
Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce
In doing what we most in suffering feel?
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need
With dangerous expedition to invade
Heavn, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,
Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find
Some easier enterprize?  There is a place
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heavn
Err not) another World, the happy seat
Of som new Race calld _Man_, about this time
To be created like to us, though less
In power and excellence, but favourd more
Of him who rules above; so was his will
Pronouncd among the Gods, and by an Oath,
That shook Heavns whol circumference, confirmd.
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,
Or substance, how endud, and what thir Power,
And where thir weakness, how attempted best,
By force or suttlety: Though Heavn be shut,
And Heavns high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength, this place may lye exposd
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps
Som advantagious act may be achievd
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire
To waste his whole Creation, or possess
All as our own, and drive as we were driven,
The punie habitants, or if not drive,
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works.  This would surpass
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons
Hurld headlong to partake with us, shall curse
Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,
Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain Empires.  Thus _Beelzebub_
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devisd
By _Satan_, and in part proposd: for whence,
But from the Author of all ill could Spring
So deep a malice, to confound the race
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve, done all to spite
The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves
His glory to augment.  The bold design
Pleasd highly those infernal States, and joy
Sparkld in all thir eyes; with full assent
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.

Well have ye judgd, well ended long debate,
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,
Great things resolvd; which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Re-enter Heavn; or else in some milde Zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heavns fair Light
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires
Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send
In search of this new world, whom shall we find
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet
The dark unbottomd infinite Abyss
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight
Upborn with indefatigable wings
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick
Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need
All circumspection, and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,
The weight of all and our last hope relies.

This said, he sat; and expectation held
His look suspence, awaiting who appeerd
To second, or oppose, or undertake
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each
In others countnance red his own dismay
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime
Of those Heavn-warring Champions could be found
So hardie as to proffer or accept
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last
_Satan_, whom now transcendent glory raisd
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth, unmovd thus spake.

O Progeny of Heavn, Empyreal Thrones,
With reason hath deep silence and demurr
Seisd us, though undismaid: long is the way
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,
Outrageous to devour, immures us round
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant
Barrd over us prohibit all egress.
These past, if any pass, the void profound
Of unessential Night receives him next
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being
Threatens him, plungd in that abortive gulf.
If thence he scape into what ever world,
Or unknown Region, what remains him less
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,
And this Imperial Sovranty, adornd
With splendor, armd with power, if aught proposd
And judgd of public moment, in the shape
Of difficulty or danger could deterre
Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,
Refusing to accept as great a share
Of hazard as of honour, due alike
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due
Of hazard more, as he above the rest
High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,
Terror of Heavn, though falln; intend at home,
While here shall be our home, what best may ease
The present misery, and render Hell
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize
None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose
The Monarch, and prevented all reply,
Prudent, least from his resolution raisd
Others among the chief might offer now
(Certain to be refusd) what erst they feard;
And so refusd might in opinion stand
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute
Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they
Dreaded not more th adventure then his voice
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;
Thir rising all at once was as the sound
Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend
With awful reverence prone; and as a God
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heavn:
Nor faild they to express how much they praisd,
That for the general safety he despisd
His own: for neither do the Spirits damnd
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,
Or close ambition varnisht ore with zeal.
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, orespread
Heavns chearful face, the lowring Element
Scowls ore the darknd lantskip Snow, or showre;
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet
Extend his evning beam, the fields revive,
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.
O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damnd
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree
Of Creatures rational, though under hope
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:
As if (which might induce us to accord)
Man had not hellish foes anow besides,
That day and night for his destruction waite.

The _Stygian_ Councel thus dissolvd; and forth
In order came the grand infernal Peers,
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd
Alone th Antagonist of Heavn, nor less
Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,
And God-like imitated State; him round
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclosd
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie
By Haralds voice explaind: the hollow Abyss
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell
With deafning shout, returnd them loud acclaim.
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat raisd
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers
Disband, and wandring, each his several way
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime
Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,
As at th Olympian Games or _Pythian_ fields;
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears
Wagd in the troubld Skie, and Armies rush
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van
Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms
From either end of Heavn the welkin burns.
Others with vast _Typhoean_ rage more fell
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.
As when _Alcides_ from _Oealia_ Crownd
With conquest, felt th envenomd robe, and tore
Through pain up by the roots _Thessalian_ Pines,
And _Lichas_ from the top of _Oeta_ threw
Into th _Euboic_ Sea.  Others more milde,
Retreated in a silent valley, sing
With notes Angelical to many a Harp
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
Thir song was partial, but the harmony
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)
Others apart sat on a Hill retird,
In thoughts more elevate, and reasond high
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.
Of good and evil much they argud then,
Of happiness and final misery,
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
Fallacious hope, or arm th obdured brest
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,
On bold adventure to discover wide
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;
Abhorred _Styx_ the flood of deadly hate,
Sad _Acheron_ of sorrow, black and deep;
_Cocytus_, namd of lamentation loud
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce _Phlegeton_
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,
_Lethe_ the River of Oblivion roules
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
A gulf profound as that _Serbonian_ Bog
Betwixt _Damiata_ and mount _Casius_ old,
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air
Burns frore, and cold performs th effect of Fire.
Thither by harpy-footed Furies haild,
At certain revolutions all the damnd
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.
They ferry over this _Lethean_ Sound
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
All in one moment, and so neer the brink;
But fate withstands, and to oppose th attempt
_Medusa_ with _Gorgonian_ terror guards
The Ford, and of it self the water flies
All taste of living wight, as once it fled
The lip of _Tantalus_.  Thus roving on
In confusd march forlorn, th adventrous Bands
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast
Viewd first thir lamentable lot, and found
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile
They passd, and many a Region dolorous,
Ore many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,
A Universe of death, which God by curse
Created evil, for evil only good,
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
Abominable, inutterable, and worse
Then Fables yet have feignd, or fear conceivd,
_Gorgons_ and _Hydras_, and _Chimeras_ dire.

Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,
_Satan_ with thoughts inflamd of highest design,
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight; som times
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares
Up to the fiery concave touring high.
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descrid
Hangs in the Clouds, by _Aequinoctial_ Winds
Close sailing from _Bengala_, or the Iles
Of _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood
Through the wide _Ethiopian_ to the Cape
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seemd
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,
Impenitrable, impald with circling fire,
Yet unconsumd.  Before the Gates there sat
On either side a formidable shape;
The one seemd Woman to the waste, and fair,
But ended foul in many a scaly fould
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent armd
With mortal sting: about her middle round
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing barkd
With wide _Cerberean_ mouths full loud, and rung
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,
If aught disturbd thir noyse, into her woomb,
And kennel there, yet there still barkd and howld
Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these
Vexd _Scylla_ bathing in the Sea that parts
_Calabria_ from the hoarce _Trinacrian_ shore:
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when calld
In secret, riding through the Air she comes
Lurd with the smell of infant blood, to dance
With _Lapland_ Witches, while the labouring Moon
Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,
If shape it might be calld that shape had none
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,
Or substance might be calld that shadow seemd,
For each seemd either; black it stood as Night,
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seemd his head
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.
_Satan_ was now at hand, and from his seat
The Monster moving onward came as fast,
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.
Th undaunted Fiend what this might be admird,
Admird, not feard; God and his Son except,
Created thing naught vallud he nor shund;
And with disdainful look thus first began.

Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,
That darst, though grim and terrible, advance
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,
That be assurd, without leave askt of thee:
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heavn.

To whom the Goblin full of wrauth replyd,
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,
Who first broke peace in Heavn and Faith, till then
Unbrokn, and in proud rebellious Arms
Drew after him the third part of Heavns Sons
Conjurd against the highest, for which both Thou
And they outcast from God, are here condemnd
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?
And recknst thou thy self with Spirits of Heavn,
Hell-doomd, and breathst defiance here and scorn,
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,
Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.

So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold
More dreadful and deform: on th other side
Incenct with indignation _Satan_ stood
Unterrifid, and like a Comet burnd,
That fires the length of _Ophiucus_ huge
In th Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head
Leveld his deadly aime; thir fatall hands
No second stroke intend, and such a frown
Each cast at th other, as when two black Clouds
With Heavns Artillery fraught, come rattling on
Over the _Caspian_, then stand front to front
Hovring a space, till Winds the signal blow
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;
For never but once more was either like
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
Had been achievd, whereof all Hell had rung,
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,
Risn, and with hideous outcry rushd between.

O Father, what intends thy hand, she cryd,
Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son,
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart
Against thy Fathers head? and knowst for whom;
For him who sits above and laughs the while
At thee ordaind his drudge, to execute
What ere his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.

She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
Forbore, then these to her _Satan_ returnd:

So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends; till first I know of thee,
What thing thou art, thus double-formd, and why
In this infernal Vaile first met thou callst
Me Father, and that Fantasm callst my Son?
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable then him and thee.

T whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate replyd;
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair
In Heavn, when at th Assembly, and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combind
In bold conspiracy against Heavns King,
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surprisd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth, till on the left side opning wide,
Likest to thee in shape and countnance bright,
Then shining heavnly fair, a Goddess armd
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seisd
All th Host of Heavn; back they recoild affraid
At first, and calld me _Sin_, and for a Sign
Portentous held me; but familiar grown,
I pleasd, and with attractive graces won
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing
Becamst enamourd, and such joy thou tookst
With me in secret, that my womb conceivd
A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,
And fields were fought in Heavn; wherein remaind
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell
Drivn headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down
Into this Deep, and in the general fall
I also; at which time this powerful Key
Into my hand was givn, with charge to keep
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass
Without my opning.  Pensive here I sat
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew
Transformd: but he my inbred enemie
Forth issud, brandishing his fatal Dart
Made to destroy: I fled, and cryd out _Death_;
Hell trembld at the hideous Name, and sighd
From all her Caves, and back resounded _Death_.
I fled, but he pursud (though more, it seems,
Inflamd with lust then rage) and swifter far,
Me overtook his mother all dismaid,
And in embraces forcible and foule
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceivd
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
To me, for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth
Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,
That rest or intermission none I find.
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim _Death_ my Son and foe, who sets them on,
And me his Parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey, but that he knows
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronouncd.
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,
Though temperd heavnly, for that mortal dint,
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.

She finishd, and the suttle Fiend his lore
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.
Dear Daughter, since thou claimst me for thy Sire,
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heavn, and joys
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know
I come no enemie, but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain,
Both him and thee, and all the heavnly Host
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses armd
Fell with us from on high: from them I go
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread
Th unfounded deep, & through the void immense
To search with wandring quest a place foretold
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now
Created vast and round, a place of bliss
In the Pourlieues of Heavn, and therein plact
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply
Perhaps our vacant room, though more removd,
Least Heavn surchargd with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught
Then this more secret now designd, I haste
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalmd
With odours; there ye shall be fed and filld
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.
He ceasd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear
His famine should be filld, and blest his mawe
Destind to that good hour: no less rejoycd
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.

The key of this infernal Pit by due,
And by command of Heavns all-powerful King
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
These Adamantine Gates; against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,
Fearless to be orematcht by living might.
But what ow I to his commands above
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of _Tartarus_ profound,
To sit in hateful Office here confind,
Inhabitant of Heavn, and heavnlie-born,
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,
With terrors and with clamors compasst round
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou
My being gavst me; whom should I obey
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss, among
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.

Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,
Which but her self not all the _Stygian_ powers
Could once have movd; then in the key-hole turns
Th intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease
Unfastns: on a sudden opn flie
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound
Th infernal dores, and on thir hinges great
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
Of _Erebus_.  She opnd, but to shut
Exceld her power; the Gates wide opn stood,
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark
Illimitable Ocean without bound,
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night
And _Chaos_, Ancestors of Nature, hold
Eternal _Anarchie_, amidst the noise
Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag
Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,
Light-armd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
Swarm populous, unnumberd as the Sands
Of _Barca_ or _Cyrenes_ torrid soil,
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise
Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,
Hee rules a moment; _Chaos_ Umpire sits,
And by decision more imbroiles the fray
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter
_Chance_ governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt
Confusdly, and which thus must ever fight,
Unless th Almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more Worlds,
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and lookd a while,
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith
He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peald
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
Great things with small) then when _Bellona_ storms,
With all her battering Engines bent to rase
Som Capital City, or less then if this frame
Of Heavn were falling, and these Elements
In mutinie had from her Axle torn
The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets
A vast vacuitie: all unawares
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft: that furie stayd,
Quencht in a Boggie _Syrtris_, neither Sea,
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,
Pursues the _Arimaspian_, who by stelth
Had from his wakeful custody purloind
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:
At length a universal hubbub wilde
Of stunning sounds and voices all confusd
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,
Undaunted to meet there what ever power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne
Of _Chaos_, and his dark Pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthrond
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood
_Orcus_ and _Ades_, and the dreaded name
Of _Demogorgon_; Rumor next and Chance,
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.

T whom _Satan_ turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,
_Chaos_ and _Ancient Night_, I come no Spie,
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint
Wandring this darksome desart, as my way
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds
Confine with Heavn; or if som other place
From your Dominion won, th Ethereal King
Possesses lately, thither to arrive
I travel this profound, direct my course;
Directed, no mean recompence it brings
To your behoof, if I that Region lost,
All usurpation thence expelld, reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
(Which is my present journey) and once more
Erect the Standerd there of _Ancient Night_;
Yours be th advantage all, mine the revenge.

Thus _Satan_; and him thus the Anarch old
With faultring speech and visage incomposd
Answerd.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art,
That mighty leading Angel, who of late
Made head against Heavns King, though overthrown.
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
Confusion worse confounded; and Heavn Gates
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands
Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,
That little which is left so to defend
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World
Hung ore my Realm, linkd in a golden Chain
To that side Heavn from whence your Legions fell:
If that way be your walk, you have not farr;
So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.

He ceasd; and _Satan_ staid not to reply,
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,
With fresh alacritie and force renewd
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round
Environd wins his way; harder beset
And more endangerd, then when _Argo_ passd
Through _Bosporus_ betwixt the justling Rocks:
Or when _Ulysses_ on the Larbord shunnd
_Charybdis_, and by th other whirlpool steard.
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Movd on, with difficulty and labour hee;
But hee once past, soon after when man fell,
Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain
Following his track, such was the will of Heavn,
Pavd after him a broad and beatn way
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf
Tamely endurd a Bridge of wondrous length
From Hell continud reaching th utmost Orbe
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
With easie intercourse pass to and fro
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
God and good Angels guard by special grace.
But now at last the sacred influence
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heavn
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins
Her fardest verge, and _Chaos_ to retire
As from her outmost works a brokn foe
With tumult less and with less hostile din,
That _Satan_ with less toil, and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold
Farr off th Empyreal Heavn, extended wide
In circuit, undetermind square or round,
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adornd
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.

      THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK III.

Hail holy light, ofspring of Heavn first-born,
Or of th Eternal Coeternal beam
May I express thee unblamd? since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
Or hearst thou rather pure Ethereal stream,
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
Escapt the _Stygian_ Pool, though long detaind
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes then to th _Orphean_ Lyre
I sung of _Chaos_ and _Eternal Night_,
Taught by the heavnly Muse to venture down
The dark descent, and up to reascend,
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou
Revisitst not these eyes, that rowle in vain
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,
Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
Thee _Sion_ and the flowrie Brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget
Those other two equald with me in Fate,
So were I equald with them in renown,
Blind _Thamyris_ and blind _Maeonides_,
And _Tiresias_ and _Phineus_ Prophets old.
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year
Seasons return, but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of Evn or Morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark
Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men
Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair
Presented with a Universal blanc
Of Natures works to mee expungd and rasd,
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.
So much the rather thou Celestial light
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight.

Now had the Almighty Father from above,
From the pure Empyrean where he sits
High Thrond above all highth, bent down his eye,
His own works and their works at once to view:
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receivd
Beatitude past utterance; on his right
The radiant image of his Glory sat,
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plact,
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love
In blissful solitude; he then surveyd
Hell and the Gulf between, and _Satan_ there
Coasting the wall of Heavn on this side Night
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet
On the bare outside of this World, that seemd
Firm land imbosomd without Firmament,
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.
Him God beholding from his prospect high,
Wherein past, present, future he beholds,
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.

Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds
Prescribd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems
On desperat revenge, that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head.  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not farr off Heavn, in the Precincts of light,
Directly towards the new created World,
And Man there plact, with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy, or worse,
By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;
For man will hearkn to his glozing lyes,
And easily transgress the sole Command,
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee
All he could have; I made him just and right,
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
Such I created all th Ethereal Powers
And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild;
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,
Not what they would? what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid,
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,
Made passive both, had servd necessitie,
Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,
So were created, nor can justly accuse
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;
As if Predestination over-ruld
Thir will, disposd by absolute Decree
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,
Which had no less provd certain unforeknown.
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so
I formd them free, and free they must remain,
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordaind
Thir freedom, they themselves ordaind thir fall.
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,
Self-tempted, self-depravd: Man falls deceivd
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,
Through Heavn and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.

Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance filld
All Heavn, and in the blessed Spirits elect
Sense of new joy ineffable diffusd:
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon
Substantially expressd, and in his face
Divine compassion visibly appeerd,
Love without end, and without measure Grace,
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.

O Father, gracious was that word which closd
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;
For which both Heavn and Earth shall high extoll
Thy praises, with th innumerable sound
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne
Encompassd shall resound thee ever blest.
For should Man finally be lost, should Man
Thy creature late so lovd, thy youngest Son
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd
With his own folly? that be from thee farr,
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge
Of all things made, and judgest onely right.
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,
Or proud return though to his heavier doom,
Yet with revenge accomplisht and to Hell
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be questiond and blaspheamd without defence.

To whom the great Creatour thus replyd.
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,
All hast thou spokn as my thoughts are, all
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:
Man shall not quite be lost, but savd who will,
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthralld
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal foe,
By me upheld, that he may know how frail
His falln condition is, and to me ow
All his delivrance, and to none but me.
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
Elect above the rest; so is my will:
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes
Th incensed Deitie, while offerd grace
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,
What may suffice, and softn stonie hearts
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,
Though but endevord with sincere intent,
Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
And I will place within them as a guide
My Umpire _Conscience_, whom if they will hear,
Light after light well usd they shall attain,
And to the end persisting, safe arrive.
This my long sufferance and my day of grace
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
But hard be hardnd, blind be blinded more,
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;
And none but such from mercy I exclude.
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns
Against the high Supremacie of Heavn,
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,
To expiate his Treason hath naught left,
But to destruction sacred and devote,
He with his whole posteritie must die,
Die hee or Justice must; unless for him
Som other able, and as willing, pay
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
Say Heavnly Powers, where shall we find such love,
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem
Mans mortal crime, and just th unjust to save,
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?

He askd, but all the Heavnly Quire stood mute,
And silence was in Heavn: on mans behalf
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,
Much less that durst upon his own head draw
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have bin lost, adjudgd to Death and Hell
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,
His dearest mediation thus renewd.

Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
The speediest of thy winged messengers,
To visit all thy creatures, and to all
Comes unprevented, unimplord, unsought,
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;
Attonement for himself or offering meet,
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee
Freely put off, and for him lastly die
Well pleasd, on me let Death wreck all his rage;
Under his gloomie power I shall not long
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,
Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule
For ever with corruption there to dwell;
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue
My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarmd.
I through the ample Air in Triumph high
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show
The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight
Pleasd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,
While by thee raisd I ruin all my Foes,
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:
Then with the multitude of my redeemd
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud
Of anger shall remain, but peace assurd,
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more
Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.

His words here ended, but his meek aspect
Silent yet spake, and breathd immortal love
To mortal men, above which only shon
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
Glad to be offerd, he attends the will
Of his great Father.  Admiration seisd
All Heavn, what this might mean, & whither tend
Wondring; but soon th Almighty thus replyd:

O thou in Heavn and Earth the only peace
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou
My sole complacence! well thou knowst how dear,
To me are all my works, nor Man the least
Though last created, that for him I spare
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;
And be thy self Man among men on Earth,
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,
By wondrous birth: Be thou in _Adams_ room
The Head of all mankind, though _Adams_ Son.
As in him perish all men, so in thee
As from a second root shall be restord,
As many as are restord, without thee none.
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee
Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,
Shall satisfie for Man, be judgd and die,
And dying rise, and rising with him raise
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.
So Heavnly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate
So easily destroyd, and still destroyes
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
Mans Nature, lessn or degrade thine owne.
Because thou hast, though Thrond in highest bliss
Equal to God, and equally enjoying
God-like fruition, quitted all to save
A World from utter loss, and hast been found
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,
Found worthiest to be so by being Good,
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,
Anointed universal King; all Power
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;
When thou attended gloriously from Heavn
Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes
The living, and forthwith the cited dead
Of all past Ages to the general Doom
Shall hastn, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.
Then all thy Saints assembld, thou shalt judge
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring
New Heavn and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell
And after all thir tribulations long
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,
For regal Scepter then no more shall need,
God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,
Adore him, who to compass all this dies,
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.

No sooner had th Almighty ceast, but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heavn rung
With Jubilee, and loud Hosannas filld
Th eternal Regions: lowly reverent
Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence
To Heavn removd where first it grew, there grows,
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn
Rowls ore _Elisian_ Flours her Amber stream;
With these that never fade the Spirits Elect
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreathd with beams,
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon
Impurpld with Celestial Roses smild.
Then Crownd again thir goldn Harps they took,
Harps ever tund, that glittering by their side
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet
Of charming symphonie they introduce
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine
Melodious part, such concord is in Heavn.

Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
Thrond inaccessible, but when thou shadst
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,
Yet dazle Heavn, that brightest Seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
In whose conspicuous countnance, without cloud
Made visible, th Almighty Father shines,
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,
Transfusd on thee his ample Spirit rests.
Hee Heavn of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created, and by thee threw down
Th aspiring Dominations: thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
Heavns everlasting Frame, while ore the necks
Thou drovst of warring Angels disarraid.
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime
Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
Not so on Man; him through their malice falln,
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son
Perceive thee purposd not to doom frail Man
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclind,
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife
Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discernd,
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat
Second to thee, offerd himself to die
For mans offence.  O unexampld love,
Love no where to be found less then Divine!
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
Shall be the copious matter of my Song
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.

Thus they in Heavn, above the starry Sphear,
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
Of this round World, whose first convex divides
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclosd
From _Chaos_ and th inroad of Darkness old,
_Satan_ alighted walks: a Globe farr off
It seemd, now seems a boundless Continent
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
Starless exposd, and ever-threatning storms
Of _Chaos_ blustring round, inclement skie;
Save on that side which from the wall of Heavn
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:
Here walkd the Fiend at large in spacious field.
As when a Vultur on _Imaus_ bred,
Whose snowie ridge the roving _Tartar_ bounds,
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
Of _Ganges_ or _Hydaspes, Indian_ streams;
But in his way lights on the barren plaines
Of _Sericana_, where _Chineses_ drive
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend
Walkd up and down alone bent on his prey,
Alone, for other Creature in this place
Living or liveless to be found was none,
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin
With vanity had filld the works of men:
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,
Or happiness in this or th other life;
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;
All th unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,
Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
Till final dissolution, wander here,
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt th Angelical and Human kinde:
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
First from the ancient World those Giants came
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:
The builders next of _Babel_ on the Plain
Of _Sennaar_, and still with vain designe
New _Babels_, had they wherewithall, would build:
Others came single; hee who to be deemd
A God, leapd fondly into _Aetna_ flames,
_Empedocles_, and hee who to enjoy
_Platos Elysium_, leapd into the Sea,
_Cleombrotus_, and many more too long,
Embryos and Idiots, Eremits and Friers
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.
Here Pilgrims roam, that strayd so farr to seek
In _Golgotha_ him dead, who lives in Heavn;
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of _Dominic_,
Or in _Franciscan_ think to pass disguisd;
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs
The Trepidation talkt, and that first movd;
And now Saint _Peter_ at Heavns Wicket seems
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
Of Heavns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe
A violent cross wind from either Coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
Into the devious Air; then might ye see
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft
Fly ore the backside of the World farr off
Into a _Limbo_ large and broad, since calld
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
Long after, now unpeopld, and untrod;
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passd,
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste
His travelld steps; farr distant hee descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
The Stairs were such as whereon _Jacob_ saw
Angels ascending and descending, bands
Of Guardians bright, when he from _Esau_ fled
To _Padan-Aram_ in the field of _Luz_,
Dreaming by night under the open Skie,
And waking crid, This is the Gate of Heavn.
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
There alwaies, but drawn up to Heavn somtimes
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flowd
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon
Who after came from Earth, sayling arrivd,
Wafted by Angels, or flew ore the Lake
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.
Direct against which opnd from beneath,
Just ore the blissful seat of Paradise,
A passage down to th Earth, a passage wide,
Wider by farr then that of after-times
Over Mount _Sion_, and, though that were large,
Over the _Promisd Land_ to God so dear,
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
On high behests his Angels to and fro
Passd frequent, and his eye with choice regard
From _Paneas_ the fount of _Jordans_ flood
To _Beersaba_, where the _Holy Land_
Borders on _Aegypt_ and the _Arabian_ shoare;
So wide the opning seemd, where bounds were set
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.
_Satan_ from hence now on the lower stair
That scald by steps of Gold to Heavn Gate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some forein land
First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.
Such wonder seisd, though after Heaven seen,
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seisd
At sight of all this World beheld so faire.
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood
So high above the circling Canopie
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point
Of _Libra_ to the fleecie Starr that bears
_Andromeda_ farr off _Atlantick_ Seas
Beyond th _Horizon_; then from Pole to Pole
He views in bredth, and without longer pause
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,
Like those _Hesperian_ Gardens famd of old,
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there
He stayd not to enquire: above them all
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven
Allurd his eye: Thither his course he bends
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute
Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp
Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms
The Univers, and to each inward part
With gentle penetration, though unseen,
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:
So wondrously was set his Station bright.
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the Suns lucent Orbe
Through his glazd Optic Tube yet never saw.
The place he found beyond expression bright,
Compard with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;
Not all parts like, but all alike informd
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon
In _Aarons_ Brest-plate, and a stone besides
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,
That stone, or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde
Volatil _Hermes_, and call up unbound
In various shapes old _Proteus_ from the Sea,
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth _Elixir_ pure, and Rivers run
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch
Th Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazld, farr and wide his eye commands,
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon
Culminate from th _Aequator_, as they now
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,
No where so cleer, sharpnd his visual ray
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,
The same whom _John_ saw also in the Sun:
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar
Circld his Head, nor less his Locks behind
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings
Lay waving round; on som great charge imployd
Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandring flight
To Paradise the happie seat of Man,
His journies end and our beginning woe.
But first he casts to change his proper shape,
Which else might work him danger or delay:
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
Youth smild Celestial, and to every Limb
Sutable grace diffusd, so well he feignd;
Under a Coronet his flowing haire
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore
Of many a colourd plume sprinkld with Gold,
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,
Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known
Th Arch-Angel _Uriel_, one of the seavn
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes
That run through all the Heavns, or down to th Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
Ore Sea and Land: him _Satan_ thus accostes;

_Uriel_, for thou of those seavn Spirits that stand
In sight of Gods high Throne, gloriously bright,
The first art wont his great authentic will
Interpreter through highest Heavn to bring,
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;
And here art likeliest by supream decree
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye
To visit oft this new Creation round;
Unspeakable desire to see, and know
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,
His chief delight and favour, him for whom
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim
Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;
That I may find him, and with secret gaze,
Or open admiration him behold
On whom the great Creator hath bestowd
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;
That both in him and all things, as is meet,
The Universal Maker we may praise;
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss
Created this new happie Race of Men
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.

So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks
Invisible, except to God alone,
By his permissive will, through Heavn and Earth:
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguild
_Uriel_, though Regent of the Sun, and held
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heavn;
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule
In his uprightness answer thus returnd.
Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know
The works of God, thereby to glorifie
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
Contented with report heare onely in heavn:
For wonderful indeed are all his works,
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;
But what created mind can comprehend
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,
This worlds material mould, came to a heap:
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar
Stood ruld, stood vast infinitude confind;
Till at his second bidding darkness fled,
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heavn
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;
Each had his place appointed, each his course,
The rest in circuit walles this Universe.
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light
His day, which else as th other Hemisphere
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide
Timely interposes, and her monthly round
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heavn;
With borrowd light her countenance triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th Earth,
And in her pale dominion checks the night.
That spot to which I point is _Paradise_,
_Adams_ abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.

Thus said, he turnd, and _Satan_ bowing low,
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,
Down from th Ecliptic, sped with hopd success,
Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,
Nor staid, till on _Niphates_ top he lights.

       THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK IV.

O For that warning voice, which he who saw
Th _Apocalyps_, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
Came furious down to be revengd on men,
_Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth!_ that now,
While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd
The coming of thir secret foe, and scapd
Haply so scapd his mortal snare; for now
_Satan_, now first inflamd with rage, came down,
The Tempter ere th Accuser of man-kind,
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract
His troubld thoughts, and from the bottom stirr
The Hell within him, for within him Hell
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell
One step no more then from himself can fly
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie
Of what he was, what is, and what must be
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
Sometimes towards _Eden_ which now in his view
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,
Sometimes towards Heavn and the full-blazing Sun,
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.

O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,
Lookst from thy sole Dominion like the God
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams
That bring to my remembrance from what state
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down
Warring in Heavn against Heavns matchless King:
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return
From me, whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence, and with his good
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
What could be less then to afford him praise,
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,
How due! yet all his good provd ill in me,
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
The debt immense of endless gratitude,
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;
Forgetful what from him I still receivd,
And understood not that a grateful mind
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood
Then happie; no unbounded hope had raisd
Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power
As great might have aspird, and me though mean
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great
Fell not, but stand unshakn, from within
Or from without, to all temptations armd.
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,
But Heavns free Love dealt equally to all?
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,
To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
Nay cursd be thou; since against his thy will
Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
Me miserable! which way shall I flie
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threatning to devour me opens wide,
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heavn.
O then at last relent: is there no place
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?
None left but by submission; and that word
_Disdain_ forbids me, and my dread of shame
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seducd
With other promises and other vaunts
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue
Th Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,
Under what torments inwardly I groane;
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,
With Diadem and Scepter high advancd
The lower still I fall, onely Supream
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.
But say I could repent and could obtaine
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay
What feignd submission swore: ease would recant
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have peircd so deep:
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare
Short intermission bought with double smart.
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr
From granting hee, as I from begging peace:
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead
Of us out-cast, exild, his new delight,
Mankind created, and for him this World.
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least
Divided Empire with Heavns King I hold
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.

Thus while he spake, each passion dimmd his face
Thrice changd with pale, ire, envie and despair,
Which marrd his borrowd visage, and betraid
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.
For heavnly mindes from such distempers foule
Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware,
Each perturbation smoothd with outward calme,
Artificer of fraud; and was the first
That practisd falshood under saintly shew,
Deep malice to conceale, coucht with revenge:
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive
_Uriel_ once warnd; whose eye pursud him down
The way he went, and on th _Assyrian_ mount
Saw him disfigurd, more then could befall
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,
As he supposd, all unobservd, unseen.
So on he fares, and to the border comes
Of _Eden_, where delicious Paradise,
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,
As with a rural mound the champain head
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,
Access denid; and over head up grew
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre
Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops
The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.
And higher then that Wall a circling row
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:
On which the Sun more glad impressd his beams
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile
Beyond the _Cape of Hope_, and now are past
_Mozambic_, off at Sea North-East windes blow
_Sabean_ Odours from the spicie shoare
Of _Arabie_ the blest, with such delay
Well pleasd they slack thir course, and many a League
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleasd
Then _Asmodeus_ with the fishie fume,
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse
Of _Tobits_ Son, and with a vengeance sent
From _Media_ post to _Aegypt_, there fast bound.

Now to th ascent of that steep savage Hill
_Satan_ had journied on, pensive and slow;
But further way found none, so thick entwind,
As one continud brake, the undergrowth
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext
All path of Man or Beast that past that way:
One Gate there onely was, and that lookd East
On th other side: which when th arch-fellon saw
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,
At one slight bound high overleapd all bound
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within
Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe,
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve
In hurdld Cotes amid the field secure,
Leaps ore the fence with ease into the Fould:
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,
In at the window climbes, or ore the tiles;
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,
The middle Tree and highest there that grew,
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death
To them who livd; nor on the vertue thought
Of that life-giving Plant, but only usd
For prospect, what well usd had bin the pledge
Of immortalitie.  So little knows
Any, but God alone, to value right
The good before him, but perverts best things
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.
Beneath him with new wonder now he views
To all delight of human sense exposd
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East
Of _Eden_ planted; _Eden_ stretchd her Line
From _Auran_ Eastward to the Royal Towrs
Of great _Seleucia_, built by _Grecian_ Kings,
Or where the Sons of _Eden_ long before
Dwelt in _Telassar:_ in this pleasant soile
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;
Out of the fertil ground he causd to grow
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life
Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.
Southward through _Eden_ went a River large,
Nor changd his course, but through the shaggie hill
Passd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown
That Mountain as his Garden mould high raisd
Upon the rapid current, which through veins
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,
Which from his darksom passage now appeers,
And now divided into four main Streams,
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme
And Country whereof here needs no account,
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,
With mazie error under pendant shades
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote
The open field, and where the unpierct shade
Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,
A happy rural seat of various view;
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde
Hung amiable, _Hesperian_ Fables true,
If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks
Grasing the tender herb, were interposd,
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap
Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves
Of coole recess, ore which the mantling Vine
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,
Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
The trembling leaves, while Universal _Pan_
Knit with the _Graces_ and the _Hours_ in dance
Led on th Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field
Of _Enna_, where _Proserpin_ gathring flours
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie _Dis_
Was gatherd, which cost _Ceres_ all that pain
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove
Of _Daphne_ by _Orontes_, and th inspird
_Castalian_ Spring might with this Paradise
Of _Eden_ strive; nor that _Nyseian_ Ile
Girt with the River _Triton_, where old _Cham_,
Whom Gentiles _Ammon_ call and _Libyan Jove_,
Hid _Amalthea_ and her Florid Son
Young _Bacchus_ from his Stepdame _Rheas_ eye;
Nor where _Abassin_ Kings thir issue Guard,
Mount _Amara_, though this by som supposd
True Paradise under the _Ethiop_ Line
By _Nilus_ head, enclosd with shining Rock,
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote
From this _Assyrian_ Garden, where the Fiend
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine
The image of thir glorious Maker shon,
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,
Severe, but in true filial freedom plact;
Whence true autoritie in men; though both
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;
For contemplation hee and valour formd,
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,
Hee for God only, shee for God in him:
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declard
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks
Round from his parted forelock manly hung
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste
Her unadorned golden tresses wore
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wavd
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which implid
Subjection, but requird with gentle sway,
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,
And sweet reluctant amorous delay.
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,
Sin-bred, how have ye troubld all mankind
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,
And banisht from mans life his happiest life,
Simplicitie and spotless innocence.
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair
That ever since in loves imbraces met,
_Adam_ the goodliest man of men since borne
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters _Eve_.
Under a tuft of shade that on a green
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side
They sat them down, and after no more toil
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then sufficd
To recommend coole _Zephyr_, and made ease
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,
Alone as they.  About them frisking playd
All Beasts of th Earth, since wilde, and of all chase
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw
Dandld the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards
Gambold before them, th unwieldy Elephant
To make them mirth usd all his might, & wreathd
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun
Declind was hasting now with prone carreer
To th Ocean Iles, and in th ascending Scale
Of Heavn the Starrs that usher Evening rose:
When _Satan_ still in gaze, as first he stood,
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.

O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,
Into our room of bliss thus high advanct
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,
Not Spirits, yet to heavnly Spirits bright
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh
Your change approaches, when all these delights
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;
Happie, but for so happie ill securd
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heavn
Ill fenct for Heavn to keep out such a foe
As now is enterd; yet no purposd foe
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,
And mutual amitie so streight, so close,
That I with you must dwell, or you with me
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,
To entertain you two, her widest Gates,
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,
Not like these narrow limits, to receive
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.
And should I at your harmless innocence
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,
Honour and Empire with revenge enlargd,
By conquering this new World, compels me now
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.

So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,
The Tyrants plea, excusd his devilish deeds.
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree
Down he alights among the sportful Herd
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end
Neerer to view his prey, and unespid
To mark what of thir state he more might learn
By word or action markt: about them round
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spid
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both
Gript in each paw: when _Adam_ first of men
To first of women _Eve_ thus moving speech,
Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.

Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power
That made us, and for us this ample World
Be infinitly good, and of his good
As liberal and free as infinite,
That raisd us from the dust and plact us here
In all this happiness, who at his hand
Have nothing merited, nor can performe
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires
From us no other service then to keep
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees
In Paradise that beare delicious fruit
So various, not to taste that onely Tree
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst
God hath pronounct it death to taste that Tree,
The only sign of our obedience left
Among so many signes of power and rule
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion givn
Over all other Creatures that possesse
Earth, Aire, and Sea.  Then let us not think hard
One easie prohibition, who enjoy
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice
Unlimited of manifold delights:
But let us ever praise him, and extoll
His bountie, following our delightful task
To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours,
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.

To whom thus Eve replid.  O thou for whom
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,
And without whom am to no end, my Guide
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.
For wee to him indeed all praises owe,
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee
Preeminent by so much odds, while thou
Like consort to thy self canst no where find.
That day I oft remember, when from sleep
I first awakt, and found my self reposd
Under a shade on flours, much wondring where
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
Of waters issud from a Cave and spread
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmovd
Pure as th expanse of Heavn; I thither went
With unexperienct thought, and laid me downe
On the green bank, to look into the cleer
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.
As I bent down to look, just opposite,
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd
Bending to look on me, I started back,
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,
Pleasd it returnd as soon with answering looks
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt
Mine eyes till now, and pind with vain desire,
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,
With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be calld
Mother of human Race: what could I doe,
But follow strait, invisibly thus led?
Till I espid thee, fair indeed and tall,
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,
Thou following crydst aloud, Return fair _Eve_,
Whom flist thou? whom thou flist, of him thou art,
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side
Henceforth an individual solace dear;
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim
My other half: with that thy gentle hand
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see
How beauty is excelld by manly grace
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.

So spake our general Mother, and with eyes
Of conjugal attraction unreprovd,
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast
Naked met his under the flowing Gold
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms
Smild with superior Love, as _Jupiter_
On _Juno_ smiles, when he impregns the Clouds
That shed _May_ Flowers; and pressd her Matron lip
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne
Eyd them askance, and to himself thus plaind.

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two
Imparadist in one anothers arms
The happier _Eden_, shall enjoy thir fill
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
Among our other torments not the least,
Still unfulfilld with pain of longing pines;
Yet let me not forget what I have gaind
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge calld,
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbiddn?
Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord
Envie them that? can it be sin to know,
Can it be death? and do they onely stand
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build
Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds
With more desire to know, and to reject
Envious commands, invented with designe
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?
But first with narrow search I must walk round
This Garden, and no corner leave unspid;
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
Some wandring Spirit of Heavn, by Fountain side,
Or in thick shade retird, from him to draw
What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.

So saying, his proud step he scornful turnd,
But with sly circumspection, and began
Through wood, through waste, ore hil, ore dale his roam.
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heavn
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun
Slowly descended, and with right aspect
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock
Of Alablaster, pild up to the Clouds,
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.
Betwixt these rockie Pillars _Gabriel_ sat
Chief of th Angelic Guards, awaiting night;
About him exercisd Heroic Games
Th unarmed Youth of Heavn, but nigh at hand
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.
Thither came _Uriel_, gliding through the Eeven
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr
In _Autumn_ thwarts the night, when vapors fird
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner
From what point of his Compass to beware
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.

_Gabriel_, to thee thy cours by Lot hath givn
Charge and strict watch that to this happie place
No evil thing approach or enter in;
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare
A Spirit, zealous, as he seemd, to know
More of th Almighties works, and chiefly Man
Gods latest Image: I describd his way
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;
But in the Mount that lies from _Eden_ North,
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks
Alien from Heavn, with passions foul obscurd:
Mine eye pursud him still, but under shade
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew
I fear, hath venturd from the deep, to raise
New troubles; him thy care must be to find.

To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:
_Uriel_, no wonder if thy perfet sight,
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,
See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass
The vigilance here plact, but such as come
Well known from Heavn; and since Meridian hour
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.
But if within the circuit of these walks
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.

So promisd hee, and _Uriel_ to his charge
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now falln
Beneath th _Azores_; whither the prime Orb,
Incredible how swift, had thither rowld
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth
By shorter flight to th East, had left him there
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
Silence was pleasd: now glowd the Firmament
With living Saphirs: _Hesperus_ that led
The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon
Rising in clouded Majestie, at length
Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,
And ore the dark her Silver Mantle threw.

When _Adam_ thus to _Eve_: Fair Consort, th hour
Of night, and all things now retird to rest
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set
Labour and rest, as day and night to men
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;
Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,
And the regard of Heavn on all his waies;
While other Animals unactive range,
And of thir doings God takes no account.
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East
With first approach of light, we must be risn,
And at our pleasant labour, to reform
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,
That mock our scant manuring, and require
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.

To whom thus _Eve_ with perfet beauty adornd.
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst
Unargud I obey; so God ordains,
God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.
With thee conversing I forget all time,
All seasons and thir change, all please alike.
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun
When first on this delightful Land he spreads
His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,
And these the Gemms of Heavn, her starrie train:
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,
Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?

To whom our general Ancestor replid.
Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht _Eve_,
Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,
By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land
In order, though to Nations yet unborn,
Ministring light prepard, they set and rise;
Least total darkness should by Night regaine
Her old possession, and extinguish life
In Nature and all things, which these soft fires
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate
Of various influence foment and warme,
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down
Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow
On Earth, made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.
These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,
That heavn would want spectators, God want praise;
Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:
All these with ceasless praise his works behold
Both day and night: how often from the steep
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air,
Sole, or responsive each to others note
Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk
With Heavnly touch of instrumental sounds
In full harmonic number joind, thir songs
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.

Thus talking hand in hand alone they passd
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place
Chosn by the sovran Planter, when he framd
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
_Acanthus_, and each odorous bushie shrub
Fencd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,
_Iris_ all hues, Roses, and Gessamin
Reard high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay
Broiderd the ground, more colourd then with stone
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;
Such was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,
_Pan_ or _Silvanus_ never slept, nor Nymph,
Nor _Faunus_ haunted.  Here in close recess
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs
Espoused _Eve_ deckt first her Nuptial Bed,
And heavnly Quires the Hymenaean sung,
What day the genial Angel to our Sire
Brought her in naked beauty more adornd,
More lovely then _Pandora_, whom the Gods
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son
Of _Japhet_ brought by _Hermes_, she ensnard
Mankind with her faire looks, to be avengd
On him who had stole _Joves_ authentic fire.

Thus at thir shadie Lodge arrivd, both stood,
Both turnd, and under opn Skie adord
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heavn
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe
And starrie Pole: Thou also madst the Night,
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,
Which we in our appointed work imployd
Have finisht happie in our mutual help
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss
Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place
For us too large, where thy abundance wants
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
But thou hast promisd from us two a Race
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.

This said unanimous, and other Rites
Observing none, but adoration pure
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower
Handed they went; and easd the putting off
These troublesom disguises which wee wear,
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene
_Adam_ from his fair Spouse, nor _Eve_ the Rites
Mysterious of connubial Love refusd:
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk
Of puritie and place and innocence,
Defaming as impure what God declares
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie,
In Paradise of all things common else.
By thee adulterous lust was drivn from men
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee
Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,
Relations dear, and all the Charities
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,
Whose Bed is undefild and chast pronounct,
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs usd.
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,
Or Serenate, which the starvd Lover sings
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repaird.  Sleep on,
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek
No happier state, and know to know no more.

Now had night measurd with her shaddowie Cone
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim
Forth issuing at th accustomd hour stood armd
To thir night watches in warlike Parade,
When _Gabriel_ to his next in power thus spake.

_Uzziel_, half these draw off, and coast the South
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,
Our circuit meets full West.  As flame they part
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.

_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_, with wingd speed
Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook,
But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.
This Eevning from the Suns decline arrivd
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escapd
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.

So saying, on he led his radiant Files,
Dazling the Moon; these to the Bower direct
In search of whom they sought: him there they found
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of _Eve_;
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
Th animal Spirits that from pure blood arise
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.
Him thus intent _Ithuriel_ with his Spear
Touchd lightly; for no falshood can endure
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts
Discoverd and surprizd.  As when a spark
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine
With sudden blaze diffusd, inflames the Aire:
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
Back stept those two fair Angels half amazd
So sudden to behold the grieslie King;
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.

Which of those rebell Spirits adjudgd to Hell
Comst thou, escapd thy prison, and transformd,
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?

Know ye not then said _Satan_, filld with scorn,
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
Your message, like to end as much in vain?
To whom thus _Zephon_, answering scorn with scorn.
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known
As when thou stoodst in Heavn upright and pure;
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,
Departed from thee, and thou resemblst now
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
This place inviolable, and these from harm.

So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pind
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd
His lustre visibly impard; yet seemd
Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,
Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said _Zephon_ bold,
Will save us trial what the least can doe
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.

The Fiend replid not, overcome with rage;
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie
He held it vain; awe from above had quelld
His heart, not else dismaid.  Now drew they nigh
The western point, where those half-rounding guards
Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind
Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief
_Gabriel_ from the Front thus calld aloud.

O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne
_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_ through the shade,
And with them comes a third of Regal port,
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,
Not likely to part hence without contest;
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.

He scarce had ended, when those two approachd
And brief related whom they brought, wher found,
How busied, in what form and posture coucht.

To whom with stern regard thus _Gabriel_ spake.
Why hast thou, _Satan_, broke the bounds prescribd
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge
Of others, who approve not to transgress
By thy example, but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place;
Imploid it seems to violate sleep, and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?

To whom thus _Satan_ with contemptuous brow.
_Gabriel_, thou hadst in Heavn th esteem of wise,
And such I held thee; but this question askt
Puts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,
Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,
And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change
Torment with ease, & soonest recompence
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
To thee no reason; who knowst only good,
But evil hast not trid: and wilt object
His will who bound us? let him surer barr
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.
The rest is true, they found me where they say;
But that implies not violence or harme.

Thus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel movd,
Disdainfully half smiling thus replid.
O loss of one in Heavn to judge of wise,
Since _Satan_ fell, whom follie overthrew,
And now returns him from his prison scapt,
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicenct from his bounds in Hell prescribd;
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However, and to scape his punishment.
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,
Which thou incurrst by flying, meet thy flight
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provokt.
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,
The first in flight from pain, hadst thou allegd
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.

To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide
The blasting volied Thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.
But still thy words at random, as before,
Argue thy inexperience what behooves
From hard assaies and ill successes past
A faithful Leader, not to hazard all
Through wayes of danger by himself untrid.
I therefore, I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie
This new created World, whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;
Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord
High up in Heavn, with songs to hymne his Throne,
And practisd distances to cringe, not fight.

To whom the warriour Angel soon replid.
To say and strait unsay, pretending first
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,
Argues no Leader, but a lyar tract,
_Satan_, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,
O sacred name of faithfulness profand!
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;
Was this your discipline and faith ingagd,
Your military obedience, to dissolve
Allegeance to th acknowledgd Power supream?
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty, who more then thou
Once fawnd, and cringd, and servilly adord
Heavns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,
Back to th infernal pit I drag thee chaind,
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.

So threatnd hee, but _Satan_ to no threats
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replid.

Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,
Usd to the yoak, drawst his triumphant wheels
In progress through the rode of Heavn Star-pavd.

While thus he spake, th Angelic Squadron bright
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field
Of _Ceres_ ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
Prove chaff.  On th other side _Satan_ allarmd
Collecting all his might dilated stood,
Like _Teneriff_ or _Atlas_ unremovd:
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest
Sat horror Plumd; nor wanted in his graspe
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds
Might have ensud, nor onely Paradise
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope
Of Heavn perhaps, or all the Elements
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne
With violence of this conflict, had not soon
Th Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
Hung forth in Heavn his golden Scales, yet seen
Betwixt _Astrea_ and the _Scorpion_ signe,
Wherein all things created first he weighd,
The pendulous round Earth with ballanct Aire
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights
The sequel each of parting and of fight;
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;
Which _Gabriel_ spying, thus bespake the Fiend.

_Satan_, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,
Neither our own but givn; what follie then
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more
Then Heavn permits, nor mine, though doubld now
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign
Where thou art weighd, & shown how light, how weak,
If thou resist.  The Fiend lookt up and knew
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

       THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK V.

Now Morn her rosie steps in th Eastern Clime
Advancing, sowd the Earth with Orient Pearle,
When _Adam_ wakt, so customd, for his sleep
Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,
And temperat vapors bland, which th only sound
Of leaves and fuming rills, _Auroras_ fan,
Lightly dispersd, and the shrill Matin Song
Of Birds on every bough; so much the more
His wonder was to find unwaknd _Eve_
With Tresses discomposd, and glowing Cheek,
As through unquiet rest: he on his side
Leaning half-raisd, with looks of cordial Love
Hung over her enamourd, and beheld
Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,
Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice
Milde, as when _Zephyrus_ on _Flora_ breathes,
Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake
My fairest, my espousd, my latest found,
Heavns last best gift, my ever new delight,
Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field
Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring
Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,
What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed,
How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee
Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.

Such whispering wakd her, but with startld eye
On _Adam_, whom imbracing, thus she spake.

O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see
Thy face, and Morn returnd, for I this Night,
Such night till this I never passd, have dreamd,
If dreamd, not as I oft am wont, of thee,
Works of day passt, or morrows next designe,
But of offence and trouble, which my mind
Knew never till this irksom night; methought
Close at mine ear one calld me forth to walk
With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,
Why sleepst thou _Eve_? now is the pleasant time,
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake
Tunes sweetest his love-labord song; now reignes
Full Orbd the Moon, and with more pleasing light
Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,
If none regard; Heavn wakes with all his eyes,
Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;
To find thee I directed then my walk;
And on, methought, alone I passd through ways
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree
Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seemd,
Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:
And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood
One shapd & wingd like one of those from Heavn
By us oft seen; his dewie locks distilld
Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gazd;
And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surchargd,
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,
Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despisd?
Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?
This said he pausd not, but with ventrous Arme
He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror child
At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:
But he thus overjoyd, O Fruit Divine,
Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,
Forbiddn here, it seems, as onely fit
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:
And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more
Communicated, more abundant growes,
The Author not impaird, but honourd more?
Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic _Eve_,
Partake thou also; happie though thou art,
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods
Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,
But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes
Ascend to Heavn, by merit thine, and see
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell
So quicknd appetite, that I, methought,
Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds
With him I flew, and underneath beheld
The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide
And various: wondring at my flight and change
To this high exaltation; suddenly
My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,
And fell asleep; but O how glad I wakd
To find this but a dream!  Thus _Eve_ her Night
Related, and thus _Adam_ answerd sad.

Best Image of my self and dearer half,
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
Affects me equally; nor can I like
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,
Created pure.  But know that in the Soule
Are many lesser Faculties that serve
Reason as chief; among these Fansie next
Her office holds; of all external things,
Which the five watchful Senses represent,
She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,
Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames
All what we affirm or what deny, and call
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
Into her private Cell when Nature rests.
Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes
To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,
Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
Som such resemblances methinks I find
Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,
But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
Evil into the mind of God or Man
May come and go, so unapprovd, and leave
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope
That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,
Waking thou never wilt consent to do.
Be not disheartnd then, nor cloud those looks
That wont to be more chearful and serene
Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,
And let us to our fresh imployments rise
Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours
That open now thir choicest bosomd smells
Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.

So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,
But silently a gentle tear let fall
From either eye, and wipd them with her haire;
Two other precious drops that ready stood,
Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell
Kissd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe, that feard to have offended.

So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.
But first from under shadie arborous roof,
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen
With wheels yet hovring ore the Ocean brim,
Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,
Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East
Of Paradise and _Edens_ happie Plains,
Lowly they bowd adoring, and began
Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid
In various style, for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounct or sung
Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence
Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,
More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp
To add more sweetness, and they thus began.

These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
Almightie, thine this universal Frame,
Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!
Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens
To us invisible or dimly seen
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare
Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:
Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,
Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs
And choral symphonies, Day without Night,
Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heavn,
On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,
If better thou belong not to the dawn,
Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn
With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare
While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.
Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,
Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise
In thy eternal course, both when thou climbst,
And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst.
Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now flist
With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,
And yee five other wandring Fires that move
In mystic Dance not without Song, resound
His praise, who out of Darkness calld up Light.
Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth
Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run
Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix
And nourish all things, let your ceasless change
Varie to our great Maker still new praise.
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,
Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,
In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,
Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,
Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,
Rising or falling still advance his praise.
His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,
Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,
With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.
Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,
That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;
Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk
The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,
To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade
Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.
Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still
To give us onely good; and if the night
Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.

So prayd they innocent, and to thir thoughts
Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.
On to thir mornings rural work they haste
Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row
Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr
Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check
Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine
To wed her Elm; she spousd about him twines
Her mariageable arms, and with her brings
Her dowr th adopted Clusters, to adorn
His barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld
With pittie Heavns high King, and to him calld
_Raphael_, the sociable Spirit, that deignd
To travel with _Tobias_, and securd
His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.

_Raphael_, said hee, thou hearst what stir on Earth
_Satan_ from Hell scapt through the darksom Gulf
Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd
This night the human pair, how he designes
In them at once to ruin all mankind.
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend
Converse with _Adam_, in what Bowre or shade
Thou findst him from the heat of Noon retird,
To respit his day-labour with repast,
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,
As may advise him of his happie state,
Happiness in his power left free to will,
Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,
Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware
He swerve not too secure: tell him withall
His danger, and from whom, what enemie
Late falln himself from Heavn, is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss;
By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,
But by deceit and lies; this let him know,
Least wilfully transgressing he pretend
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.

So spake th Eternal Father, and fulfilld
All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint
After his charge receivd, but from among
Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood
Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light
Flew through the midst of Heavn; th angelic Quires
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
Through all th Empyreal road; till at the Gate
Of Heavn arrivd, the gate self-opend wide
On golden Hinges turning, as by work
Divine the sovran Architect had framd.
From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
Starr interposd, however small he sees,
Not unconform to other shining Globes,
Earth and the Gardn of God, with Cedars crownd
Above all Hills.  As when by night the Glass
Of _Galileo_, less assurd, observes
Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:
Or Pilot from amidst the _Cyclades_
_Delos_ or _Samos_ first appeering kenns
A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight
He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie
Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing
Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann
Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare
Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems
A _Phoenix_, gazd by all, as that sole Bird
When to enshrine his reliques in the Suns
Bright Temple, to _Aegyptian Thebs_ he flies.
At once on th Eastern cliff of Paradise
He lights, and to his proper shape returns
A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade
His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad
Each shoulder broad, came mantling ore his brest
With regal Ornament; the middle pair
Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round
Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold
And colours dipt in Heavn; the third his feet
Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile
Skie-tincturd grain.  Like _Maias_ son he stood,
And shook his Plumes, that Heavnly fragrance filld
The circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands
Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
And to his message high in honour rise;
For on som message high they guessd him bound.
Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,
And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will
Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.
Him through the spicie Forrest onward com
_Adam_ discernd, as in the dore he sat
Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun
Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme
Earths inmost womb, more warmth then _Adam_ need;
And _Eve_ within, due at her hour prepard
For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,
Berrie or Grape: to whom thus _Adam_ calld.

Haste hither _Eve_, and worth thy sight behold
Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape
Comes this way moving; seems another Morn
Risn on mid-noon; som great behest from Heavn
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe
This day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed,
And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure
Abundance, fit to honour and receive
Our Heavnly stranger; well we may afford
Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies
Her fertil growth, and by disburdning grows
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.

To whom thus _Eve_. _Adam_, earths hallowd mould,
Of God inspird, small store will serve, where store,
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:
But I will haste and from each bough and break,
Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice
To entertain our Angel guest, as hee
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth
God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heavn.

So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
What choice to chuse for delicacie best,
What order, so contrivd as not to mix
Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds
In _India_ East or West, or middle shoare
In _Pontus_ or the _Punic_ Coast, or where
_Alcinous_ reignd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,
Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell
She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape
She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes
From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest
She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold
Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground
With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfumd.
Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet
His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train
Accompanid then with his own compleat
Perfections, in himself was all his state,
More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits
On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long
Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold
Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.
Neerer his presence _Adam_ though not awd,
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,
As to a superior Nature, bowing low,

Thus said.  Native of Heavn, for other place
None can then Heavn such glorious shape contain;
Since by descending from the Thrones above,
Those happie places thou hast deignd a while
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us
Two onely, who yet by sovran gift possess
This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat
Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.

Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.
_Adam_, I therefore came, nor art thou such
Created, or such place hast here to dwell,
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heavn
To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre
Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise
I have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge
They came, that like _Pomonas_ Arbour smild
With flourets deckt and fragrant smells; but _Eve_
Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair
Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feignd
Of three that in Mount _Ida_ naked strove,
Stood to entertain her guest from Heavn; no vaile
Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme
Alterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel _Haile_
Bestowd, the holy salutation usd
Long after to blest _Marie_, second _Eve_.

Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb
Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons
Then with these various fruits the Trees of God
Have heapd this Table.  Raisd of grassie terf
Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,
And on her ample Square from side to side
All _Autumn_ pild, though _Spring_ and _Autumn_ here
Dancd hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;
No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began
Our Authour.  Heavnly stranger, please to taste
These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom
All perfet good unmeasurd out, descends,
To us for food and for delight hath causd
The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps
To spiritual Natures; only this I know,
That one Celestial Father gives to all.

To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives
(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure
Intelligential substances require
As doth your Rational; and both contain
Within them every lower facultie
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
For know, whatever was created, needs
To be sustaind and fed; of Elements
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,
Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires
Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurgd
Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale
From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.
The Sun that light imparts to all, receives
From all his alimental recompence
In humid exhalations, and at Even
Sups with the Ocean: though in Heavn the Trees
Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines
Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn
We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground
Coverd with pearly grain: yet God hath here
Varied his bounty so with new delights,
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,
And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate
To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn
Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold
As from the Mine.  Mean while at Table _Eve_
Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups
With pleasant liquors crownd: O innocence
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin
Enamourd at that sight; but in those hearts
Love unlibidinous reignd, nor jealousie
Was understood, the injurd Lovers Hell.

Thus when with meats & drinks they had sufficd,
Not burdnd Nature, sudden mind arose
In _Adam_, not to let th occasion pass
Given him by this great Conference to know
Of things above his World, and of thir being
Who dwell in Heavn, whose excellence he saw
Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms
Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far
Exceeded human, and his wary speech
Thus to th Empyreal Minister he framd.

Inhabitant with God, now know I well
Thy favour, in this honour done to man,
Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaft
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
At Heavns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?

 To whom the winged Hierarch replid.
O _Adam_, one Almightie is, from whom
All things proceed, and up to him return,
If not depravd from good, created all
Such to perfection, one first matter all,
Indud with various forms, various degrees
Of substance, and in things that live, of life;
But more refind, more spiritous, and pure,
As neerer to him plact or neerer tending
Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
Proportiond to each kind.  So from the root
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
More aerie, last the bright consummate floure
Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit
Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublimd
To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,
To intellectual, give both life and sense,
Fansie and understanding, whence the soule
Reason receives, and reason is her being,
Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
If I refuse not, but convert, as you,
To proper substance; time may come when men
With Angels may participate, and find
No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit
Improvd by tract of time, and wingd ascend
Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice
Here or in Heavnly Paradises dwell;
If ye be found obedient, and retain
Unalterably firm his love entire
Whose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy
Your fill what happiness this happie state
Can comprehend, incapable of more.

To whom the Patriarch of mankind replid.
O favourable spirit, propitious guest,
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set
From center to circumference, whereon
In contemplation of created things
By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,
What meant that caution joind, _If ye be found
obedient?_ can wee want obedience then
To him, or possibly his love desert
Who formd us from the dust, and placd us here
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
Human desires can seek or apprehend?

To whom the Angel.  Son of Heavn and Earth,
Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;
That thou continust such, owe to thy self,
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
This was that caution givn thee; be advisd.
God made thee perfet, not immutable;
And good he made thee, but to persevere
He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will
By nature free, not over-ruld by Fate
Inextricable, or strict necessity;
Our voluntarie service he requires,
Not our necessitated, such with him
Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how
Can hearts, not free, be trid whether they serve
Willing or no, who will but what they must
By Destinie, and can no other choose?
My self and all th Angelic Host that stand
In sight of God enthrond, our happie state
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
On other surety none; freely we serve.
Because wee freely love, as in our will
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
And som are falln, to disobedience falln,
And so from Heavn to deepest Hell; O fall
From what high state of bliss into what woe!

To whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words
Attentive, and with more delighted eare
Divine instructer, I have heard, then when
Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills
Aereal Music send: nor knew I not
To be both will and deed created free;
Yet that we never shall forget to love
Our maker, and obey him whose command
Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts
Assurd me and still assure: though what thou tellst
Hath past in Heavn, som doubt within me move,
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,
The full relation, which must needs be strange,
Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun
Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins
His other half in the great Zone of Heavn.

Thus _Adam_ made request, and _Raphael_
After short pause assenting, thus began.

High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,
Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate
To human sense th invisible exploits
Of warring Spirits; how without remorse
The ruin of so many glorious once
And perfet while they stood; how last unfould
The secrets of another world, perhaps
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
This is dispenct, and what surmounts the reach
Of human sense, I shall delineate so,
By likning spiritual to corporal forms,
As may express them best, though what if Earth
Be but the shaddow of Heavn, and things therein
Each to other like, more then on earth is thought?

As yet this world was not, and _Chaos_ wilde
Reignd where these Heavns now rowl, where Earth now rests
Upon her Center poisd, when on a day
(For Time, though in Eternitie, applid
To motion, measures all things durable
By present, past, and future) on such day
As Heavns great Year brings forth, th Empyreal Host
Of Angels by Imperial summons calld,
Innumerable before th Almighties Throne
Forthwith from all the ends of Heavn appeerd
Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright
Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advancd,
Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare
Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve
Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;
Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblazd
Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love
Recorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes
Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,
By whom in bliss imbosomd sat the Son,
Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.

Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
Hear my Decree, which unrevokt shall stand.
This day I have begot whom I declare
My onely Son, and on this holy Hill
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold
At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;
And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow
All knees in Heavn, and shall confess him Lord:
Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide
United as one individual Soule
For ever happie: him who disobeyes
Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls
Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place
Ordaind without redemption, without end.

So spake th Omnipotent, and with his words
All seemd well pleasd, all seemd, but were not all.
That day, as other solem dayes, they spent
In song and dance about the sacred Hill,
Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare
Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
Eccentric, intervolvd, yet regular
Then most, when most irregular they seem:
And in thir motions harmonie Divine
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
Listens delighted.  Eevning approachd
(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,
We ours for change delectable, not need)
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,
Tables are set, and on a sudden pild
With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:
In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,
Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heavn.
They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet
Are filld, before th all bounteous King, who showrd
With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.
Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhald
From that high mount of God, whence light & shade
Spring both, the face of brightest Heavn had changd
To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there
In darker veile) and roseat Dews disposd
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,
Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr
Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,
(Such are the Courts of God) Th Angelic throng
Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend
By living Streams among the Trees of Life,
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course
Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne
Alternate all night long: but not so wakd
_Satan_, so call him now, his former name
Is heard no more Heavn; he of the first,
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,
In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught
With envie against the Son of God, that day
Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd
_Messiah_ King anointed, could not beare
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.
Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain,
Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolvd
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave
Unworshipt, unobeyd the Throne supream
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate
Awakning, thus to him in secret spake.

Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close
Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree
Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips
Of Heavns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
Both waking we were one; how then can now
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest imposd;
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate
What doubtful may ensue, more in this place
To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;
Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night
Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
And all who under me thir Banners wave,
Homeward with flying march where we possess
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare
Fit entertainment to receive our King
The great _Messiah_, and his new commands,
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies
Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.

So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infusd
Bad influence into th unwarie brest
Of his Associate; hee together calls,
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,
Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,
That the most High commanding, now ere Night,
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heavn,
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
Or taint integritie; but all obeyd
The wonted signal, and superior voice
Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed
His name, and high was his degree in Heavn;
His countnance, as the Morning Starr that guides
The starrie flock, allurd them, and with lyes
Drew after him the third part of Heavns Host:
Mean while th Eternal eye, whose sight discernes
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount
And from within the golden Lamps that burne
Nightly before him, saw without thir light
Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred
Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes
Were banded to oppose his high Decree;
And smiling to his onely Son thus said.

Son, thou in whom my glory I behold
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,
Neerly it now concernes us to be sure
Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms
We mean to hold what anciently we claim
Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe
Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;
Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie
In battel, what our Power is, or our right.
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw
With speed what force is left, and all imploy
In our defence, lest unawares we lose
This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.

To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer
Lightning Divine, ineffable, serene,
Made answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes
Justly hast in derision, and secure
Laughst at thir vain designes and tumults vain,
Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate
Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power
Givn me to quell thir pride, and in event
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heavn.

So spake the Son, but _Satan_ with his Powers
Farr was advanct on winged speed, an Host
Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,
Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun
Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.
Regions they passd, the mightie Regencies
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which
All thy Dominion, _Adam_, is no more
Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,
And all the Sea, from one entire globose
Stretcht into Longitude; which having passd
At length into the limits of the North
They came, and _Satan_ to his Royal seat
High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount
Raisd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs
From Diamond Quarries hewn, & Rocks of Gold,
The Palace of great _Lucifer_, (so call
That Structure in the Dialect of men
Interpreted) which not long after, hee
Affecting all equality with God,
In imitation of that Mount whereon
_Messiah_ was declard in sight of Heavn,
The Mountain of the Congregation calld;
For thither he assembld all his Train,
Pretending so commanded to consult
About the great reception of thir King,
Thither to come, and with calumnious Art
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.

Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,
If these magnific Titles yet remain
Not meerly titular, since by Decree
Another now hath to himself ingrosst
All Power, and us eclipst under the name
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste
Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,
This onely to consult how we may best
With what may be devisd of honours new
Receive him coming to receive from us
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,
Too much to one, but double how endurd,
To one and to his image now proclaimd?
But what if better counsels might erect
Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?
Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend
The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust
To know ye right, or if ye know your selves
Natives and Sons of Heavn possest before
By none, and if not equal all, yet free,
Equally free; for Orders and Degrees
Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.
Who can in reason then or right assume
Monarchie over such as live by right
His equals, if in power and splendor less,
In freedome equal? or can introduce
Law and Edict on us, who without law
Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,
And look for adoration to th abuse
Of those Imperial Titles which assert
Our being ordaind to govern, not to serve?

Thus farr his bold discourse without controule
Had audience, when among the Seraphim
_Abdiel_, then whom none with more zeale adord
The Deitie, and divine commands obeid,
Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe
The current of his fury thus opposd.

O argument blasphemous, false and proud!
Words which no eare ever to hear in Heavn
Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate
In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.
Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne
The just Decree of God, pronounct and sworn,
That to his only Son by right endud
With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heavn
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist
Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,
And equal over equals to let Reigne,
One over all with unsucceeded power.
Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute
With him the points of libertie, who made
Thee what thou art, & formd the Powrs of Heavn
Such as he pleasd, and circumscribd thir being?
Yet by experience taught we know how good,
And of our good, and of our dignitie
How provident he is, how farr from thought
To make us less, bent rather to exalt
Our happie state under one Head more neer
United.  But to grant it thee unjust,
That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:
Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count,
Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,
Equal to him begotten Son, by whom
As by his Word the mighty Father made
All things, evn thee, and all the Spirits of Heavn
By him created in thir bright degrees,
Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory namd
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers
Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscurd,
But more illustrious made, since he the Head
One of our number thus reduct becomes,
His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done
Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,
And tempt not these; but hastn to appease
Th incensed Father, and th incensed Son,
While Pardon may be found in time besought.

So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale
None seconded, as out of season judgd,
Or singular and rash, whereat rejoicd
Th Apostat, and more haughty thus replid.
That we were formd then saist thou? & the work
Of secondarie hands, by task transferd
From Father to his Son? strange point and new!
Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw
When this creation was? rememberst thou
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
We know no time when we were not as now;
Know none before us, self-begot, self-raisd
By our own quickning power, when fatal course
Had circld his full Orbe, the birth mature
Of this our native Heavn, Ethereal Sons.
Our puissance is our own, our own right hand
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try
Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold
Whether by supplication we intend
Address, and to begirt th Almighty Throne
Beseeching or besieging.  This report,
These tidings carrie to th anointed King;
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.

He said, and as the sound of waters deep
Hoarce murmur echod to his words applause
Through the infinite Host, nor less for that
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
Encompassd round with foes, thus answerd bold.

O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,
Forsakn of all good; I see thy fall
Determind, and thy hapless crew involvd
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred
Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth
No more be troubld how to quit the yoke
Of Gods _Messiah_; those indulgent Laws
Will not be now voutsaft, other Decrees
Against thee are gon forth without recall;
That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject
Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake
Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise,
Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly
These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth
Impendent, raging into sudden flame
Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel
His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
Then who created thee lamenting learne,
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.

So spake the Seraph _Abdiel_ faithful found,
Among the faithless, faithful only hee;
Among innumerable false, unmovd,
Unshakn, unseducd, unterrifid
His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;
Nor number, nor example with him wrought
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind
Though single.  From amidst them forth he passd,
Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind
Superior, nor of violence feard aught;
And with retorted scorn his back he turnd
On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doomd.

       THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK VI.

All night the dreadless Angel unpursud
Through Heavns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,
Wakt by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
Unbarrd the gates of Light.  There is a Cave
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heavn
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
Light issues forth, and at the other dore
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre
To veile the Heavn, though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heavn, arrayd in Gold
Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
Warr he perceavd, warr in procinct, and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: gladly then he mixt
Among those friendly Powers who him receavd
With joy and acclamations loud, that one
That of so many Myriads falln, yet one
Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supream; from whence a voice
From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.

Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought
The better fight, who single hast maintaind
Against revolted multitudes the Cause
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;
And for the testimonie of Truth hast born
Universal reproach, far worse to beare
Then violence: for this was all thy care
To stand approvd in sight of God, though Worlds
Judgd thee perverse: the easier conquest now
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue
By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,
Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King
_Messiah_, who by right of merit Reigns.
Goe _Michael_ of Celestial Armies Prince,
And thou in Military prowess next
_Gabriel_, lead forth to Battel these my Sons
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
By Thousands and by Millions rangd for fight;
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heavn
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf
Of _Tartarus_, which ready opens wide
His fiery _Chaos_ to receave thir fall.

So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl
In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe
Of wrauth awakt: nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:
At which command the Powers Militant,
That stood for Heavn, in mighty Quadrate joynd
Of Union irresistible, movd on
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound
Of instrumental Harmonie that breathd
Heroic Ardor to adventrous deeds
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause
Of God and his _Messiah_.  On they move
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,
Nor streitning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore
Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind
Of Birds in orderly array on wing
Came summond over _Eden_ to receive
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract
Of Heavn they marchd, and many a Province wide
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
Farr in th Horizon to the North appeerd
From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht
In battailous aspect, and neerer view
Bristld with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throngd, and Shields
Various, with boastful Argument portraid,
The banded Powers of _Satan_ hasting on
With furious expedition; for they weend
That self same day by fight, or by surprize
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
To set the envier of his State, the proud
Aspirer, but thir thoughts provd fond and vain
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd
At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
So oft in Festivals of joy and love
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
Hymning th Eternal Father: but the shout
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
High in the midst exalted as a God
Th Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclosd
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front
Presented stood in terrible array
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,
On the rough edge of battel ere it joynd,
_Satan_ with vast and haughtie strides advanct,
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;
_Abdiel_ that sight endurd not, where he stood
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
And thus his own undaunted heart explores.

O Heavn! that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie
Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might
There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?
His puissance, trusting in th Almighties aide,
I mean to try, whose Reason I have trid
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so
Most reason is that Reason overcome.

So pondering, and from his armed Peers
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
His daring foe, at this prevention more
Incenst, and thus securely him defid.

Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht
The highth of thy aspiring unopposd,
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side
Abandond at the terror of thy Power
Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain
Against th Omnipotent to rise in Arms;
Who out of smallest things could without end
Have raisd incessant Armies to defeat
Thy folly; or with solitarie hand
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow
Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith
Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then
To thee not visible, when I alone
Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent
From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late
How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.

  Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
Thus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre
Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst
From flight, seditious Angel, to receave
Thy merited reward, the first assay
Of this right hand provokt, since first that tongue
Inspird with contradiction durst oppose
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met
Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel
Vigour Divine within them, can allow
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
From me som Plume, that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest: this pause between
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;
At first I thought that Libertie and Heavn
To heavnly Soules had bin all one; but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;
Such hast thou armd, the Minstrelsie of Heavn,
Servilitie with freedom to contend,
As both thir deeds compard this day shall prove.

To whom in brief thus _Abdiel_ stern replid.
Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou depravst it with the name
Of _Servitude_ to serve whom God ordains,
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excells
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
To serve th unwise, or him who hath rebelld
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthralld;
Yet leudly darst our ministring upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve
In Heavn God ever blessed, and his Divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyd,
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.

So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud Crest of _Satan_, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong, had pusht a Mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seisd
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
Thus foild thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire
Of Battel: whereat _Michael_ bid sound
Th Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heavn
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung
_Hosanna_ to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joynd
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,
And clamour such as heard in Heavn till now
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing brayd
Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles
Of brazen Chariots ragd; dire was the noise
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
Sounder fierie Cope together rushd
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage; all Heavn
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could weild
These Elements, and arm him with the force
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power
Armie against Armie numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;
Had not th Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heavn high over-ruld
And limited thir might; though numberd such
As each divided Legion might have seemd
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
Of Battel, open when, and when to close
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
That argud fear; each on himself relid,
As onely in his arm the moment lay
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale
The Battel hung; till _Satan_, who that day
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes
No equal, raunging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confusd, at length
Saw where the Sword of _Michael_ smote, and felld
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and opposd the rockie Orb
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
A vast circumference: At his approach
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile
Surceasd, and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine War in Heavn, the arch foe subdud
Or Captive dragd in Chains, with hostile frown
And visage all enflamd first thus began.

Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
Unnamd in Heavn, now plenteous, as thou seest
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturbd
Heavns blessed peace, and into Nature brought
Miserie, uncreated till the crime
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instilld
Thy malice into thousands, once upright
And faithful, now provd false.  But think not here
To trouble Holy Rest; Heavn casts thee out
From all her Confines.  Heavn the seat of bliss
Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.
Hence then, and evil go with thee along
Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,
Or som more sudden vengeance wingd from God
Precipitate thee with augmented paine.

So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
The Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind
Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds
Thou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats
To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end
The strife which thou callst evil, but wee style
The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,
Or turn this Heavn it self into the Hell
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,
And join him namd _Almightie_ to thy aid,
I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.

They ended parle, and both addrest for fight
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
Human imagination to such highth
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,
Stood they or movd, in stature, motion, arms
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heavn.
Now wavd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields
Blazd opposite, while expectation stood
In horror; from each hand with speed retird
Where erst was thickest fight, th Angelic throng,
And left large field, unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion, such as to set forth
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
Among the Constellations warr were sprung,
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne
Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,
Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.
Together both with next to Almightie Arme,
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aimd
That might determine, and not need repeate,
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd
In might or swift prevention; but the sword
Of _Michael_ from the Armorie of God
Was givn him temperd so, that neither keen
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
The sword of _Satan_ with steep force to smite
Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,
But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shard
All his right side; then _Satan_ first knew pain,
And writhd him to and fro convolvd; so sore
The griding sword with discontinuous wound
Passd through him, but th Ethereal substance closd
Not long divisible, and from the gash
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flowd
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
By Angels many and strong, who interposd
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retird
From off the files of warr; there they him laid
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
To find himself not matchless, and his pride
Humbld by such rebuke, so farr beneath
His confidence to equal God in power.
Yet soon he heald; for Spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part, not as frail man
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,
Cannot but by annihilating die;
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.

Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd
Memorial, where the might of _Gabriel_ fought,
And with fierce Ensignes piercd the deep array
Of _Moloc_ furious King, who him defid,
And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound
Threatnd, nor from the Holie One of Heavn
Refreind his tongue blasphemous; but anon
Down clovn to the waste, with shatterd Armes
And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing
_Uriel_ and _Raphael_ his vaunting foe,
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,
Vanquishd _Adramelec_, and _Asmadai_,
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
Disdaind, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,
Mangld with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.
Nor stood unmindful _Abdiel_ to annoy
The Atheist crew, but with redoubld blow
_Ariel_ and _Arioc_, and the violence
Of _Ramiel_ scorcht and blasted overthrew.
I might relate of thousands, and thir names
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
Angels contented with thir fame in Heavn
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome
Canceld from Heavn and sacred memorie,
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise
And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires
Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:
Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.

And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swervd,
With many an inrode gord; deformed rout
Enterd, and foul disorder; all the ground
With shiverd armour strown, and on a heap
Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd
And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld
Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host
Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surprisd,
Then first with fear surprisd and sense of paine
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
By sinne of disobedience, till that hour
Not liable to fear or flight or paine.
Far otherwise th inviolable Saints
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanct entire,
Invulnerable, impenitrably armd:
Such high advantages thir innocence
Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,
Not to have disobeid; in fight they stood
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be paind
By wound, though from thir place by violence movd.

Now Night her course began, and over Heavn
Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposd,
And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:
Under her Cloudie covert both retird,
Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field
_Michael_ and his Angels prevalent
Encamping, placd in Guard thir Watches round,
Cherubic waving fires: on th other part
_Satan_ with his rebellious disappeerd,
Far in the dark dislodgd, and void of rest,
His Potentates to Councel calld by night;
And in the midst thus undismaid began.

O now in danger trid, now known in Armes
Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,
Found worthy not of Libertie alone,
Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,
Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,
Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight,
(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his Throne, and judgd
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
Of future we may deem him, though till now
Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armd,
Some disadvantage we endurd and paine,
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
Since now we find this our Empyreal forme
Incapable of mortal injurie
Imperishable, and though peircd with wound,
Soon closing, and by native vigour heald.
Of evil then so small as easie think
The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
Or equal what between us made the odds,
In Nature none: if other hidden cause
Left them Superiour, while we can preserve
Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,
Due search and consultation will disclose.

He sat; and in th assembly next upstood
_Nisroc_, of Principalities the prime;
As one he stood escapt from cruel fight,
Sore toild, his rivn Armes to havoc hewn,
And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.
Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
For Gods, and too unequal work we find
Against unequal armes to fight in paine,
Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,
But live content, which is the calmest life:
But pain is perfet miserie, the worst
Of evils, and excessive, overturnes
All patience.  He who therefore can invent
With what more forcible we may offend
Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme
Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves
No less then for deliverance what we owe.

Whereto with look composd _Satan_ replid.
Not uninvented that, which thou aright
Beleivst so main to our success, I bring;
Which of us who beholds the bright surface
Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,
This continent of spacious Heavn, adornd
With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold,
Whose Eye so superficially surveyes
These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht
With Heavns ray, and temperd they shoot forth
So beauteous, opning to the ambient light.
These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep
Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame,
Which into hallow Engins long and round
Thick-rammd, at th other bore with touch of fire
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
From far with thundring noise among our foes
Such implements of mischief as shall dash
To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,
Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.
He ended, and his words thir drooping chere
Enlightnd, and thir languisht hope revivd.
Th invention all admird, and each, how hee
To be th inventer missd, so easie it seemd
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
Impossible: yet haply of thy Race
In future dayes, if Malice should abound,
Some one intent on mischief, or inspird
With devlish machination might devise
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.
Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,
None arguing stood, innumerable hands
Were ready, in a moment up they turnd
Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath
Th originals of Nature in thir crude
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame
They found, they mingld, and with suttle Art,
Concocted and adusted they reducd
To blackest grain, and into store conveyd:
Part hiddn veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
So all ere day spring, under conscious Night
Secret they finishd, and in order set,
With silent circumspection unespid.
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heavn appeerd
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,
Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,
Where lodgd, or whither fled, or if for fight,
In motion or in alt: him soon they met
Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail
_Zephiel_, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus crid.

Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud
He comes, and settld in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure: let each
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each
Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,
Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,
If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,
But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.
So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon
In order, quit of all impediment;
Instant without disturb they took Allarm,
And onward move Embattelld; when behold
Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
Training his devilish Enginrie, impald
On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood
A while, but suddenly at head appeerd
_Satan_: And thus was heard Commanding loud.

Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;
That all may see who hate us, how we seek
Peace and composure, and with open brest
Stand readie to receive them, if they like
Our overture, and turn not back perverse;
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,
Heavn witness thou anon, while we discharge
Freely our part: yee who appointed stand
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
What we propound, and loud that all may hear.

So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
Divided, and to either Flank retird.
Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,
A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seemd
Or hollowd bodies made of Oak or Firr
With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain felld)
Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes
With hideous orifice gapt on us wide,
Portending hollow truce; at each behind
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,
Collected stood within our thoughts amusd,
Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds
Put forth, and to a narrow vent applid
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,
But soon obscurd with smoak, all Heavn appeerd,
From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar
Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule
Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
Leveld, with such impetuous furie smote,
That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowld;
The sooner for thir Arms, unarmd they might
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove; but now
Foule dissipation followd and forct rout;
Nor servd it to relax thir serried files.
What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse
Repeated, and indecent overthrow
Doubld, would render them yet more despisd,
And to thir foes a laughter; for in view
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row
In posture to displode thir second tire
Of Thunder: back defeated to return
They worse abhorrd.  _Satan_ beheld thir plight,
And to his Mates thus in derision calld.

O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,
To entertain them fair with open Front
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms
Of composition, strait they changd thir minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose
If our proposals once again were heard
We should compel them to a quick result.

To whom thus _Belial_ in like gamesom mood.
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,
Of hard contents, and full of force urgd home,
Such as we might perceive amusd them all,
And stumbld many, who receives them right,
Had need from head to foot well understand;
Not understood, this gift they have besides,
They shew us when our foes walk not upright.

So they among themselves in pleasant veine
Stood scoffing, highthnd in thir thoughts beyond
All doubt of Victorie, eternal might
To match with thir inventions they presumd
So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
And all his Host derided, while they stood
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placd)
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
(For Earth hath this variety from Heavn
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,
From thir foundations loosning to and fro
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,
Be sure, and terrour seisd the rebel Host,
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the Mountains upward turnd,
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row
They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions armd,
Thir armor helpd thir harm, crusht in and brusd
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
The rest in imitation to like Armes
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills
Hurld to and fro with jaculation dire,
That under ground they fought in dismal shade;
Infernal noise; Warr seemd a civil Game
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heavn
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,
Had not th Almightie Father where he sits
Shrind in his Sanctuarie of Heavn secure,
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
This tumult, and permitted all, advisd:
That his great purpose he might so fulfill,
To honour his Anointed Son avengd
Upon his enemies, and to declare
All power on him transferrd: whence to his Son
Th Assessor of his Throne he thus began.

Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belovd,
Son in whose face invisible is beheld
Visibly, what by Deitie I am,
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,
Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heavn,
Since _Michael_ and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met armd;
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,
Equal in their Creation they were formd,
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless, and no solution will be found:
Warr wearied hath performd what Warr can do,
And to disorderd rage let loose the reines,
With Mountains as with Weapons armd, which makes
Wild work in Heavn, and dangerous to the maine.
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;
For thee I have ordaind it, and thus farr
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine
Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou
Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace
Immense I have transfusd, that all may know
In Heavn and Hell thy Power above compare,
And this perverse Commotion governd thus,
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles
That shake Heavns basis, bring forth all my Warr,
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out
From all Heavns bounds into the utter Deep:
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
God and _Messiah_ his anointed King.

He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct
Shon full, he all his Father full exprest
Ineffably into his face receivd,
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.

O Father, O Supream of heavnly Thrones,
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,
As is most just; this I my Glorie account,
My exaltation, and my whole delight,
That thou in me well pleasd, declarst thy will
Fulfilld, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lovst:
But whom thou hatst, I hate, and can put on
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
Armd with thy might, rid heavn of these rebelld,
To thir prepard ill Mansion driven down
To chains of Darkness, and th undying Worm,
That from thy just obedience could revolt,
Whom to obey is happiness entire.
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th impure
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount
Unfained _Halleluiahs_ to thee sing,
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.
So said, he ore his Scepter bowing, rose
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,
And the third sacred Morn began to shine
Dawning through Heavn: forth rushd with whirlwind sound
The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd
Of radiant _Urim_, work divinely wrought,
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie
Sate Eagle-wingd, beside him hung his Bow
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stord,
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld
Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
He onward came, farr off his coming shon,
And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:
Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thrond.
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own
First seen, them unexpected joy surprizd,
When the great Ensign of _Messiah_ blazd
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heavn:
Under whose Conduct _Michael_ soon reducd
His Armie, circumfusd on either Wing,
Under thir Head imbodied all in one.
Before him Power Divine his way prepard;
At his command the uprooted Hills retird
Each to his place, they heard his voice and went
Obsequious, Heavn his wonted face renewd,
And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smild.
This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdurd,
And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
In heavnly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what Signs availe,
Or Wonders move th obdurate to relent?
They hardnd more by what might most reclame,
Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight
Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,
Stood reimbattelld fierce, by force or fraud
Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile
Against God and _Messiah_, or to fall
In universal ruin last, and now
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
To all his Host on either hand thus spake.

Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand
Ye Angels armd, this day from Battel rest;
Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs,
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;
Number to this dayes work is not ordaind
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd
By mee; not you but mee they have despisd,
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,
Because the Father, t whom in Heavn supream
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,
Hath honourd me according to his will.
Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assignd;
That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee
In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,
Or I alone against them, since by strength
They measure all, of other excellence
Not emulous, nor care who them excells;
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.

So spake the Son, and into terrour changd
His countnance too severe to be beheld
And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.
At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes
Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.
Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,
Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,
All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon
Among them he arrivd; in his right hand
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent
Before him, such as in thir Soules infixd
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,
All courage; down thir idle weapons dropd;
Ore Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
That wishd the Mountains now might be again
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
His arrows, from the fourfold-visagd Foure,
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,
One Spirit in them ruld, and every eye
Glard lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
Among th accurst, that witherd all thir strength,
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, falln.
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checkd
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heavn:
The overthrown he raisd, and as a Heard
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursud
With terrors and with furies to the bounds
And Chrystall wall of Heavn, which opning wide,
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclosd
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse
Urgd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw
Down from the verge of Heavn, Eternal wrauth
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.

Hell heard th unsufferable noise, Hell saw
Heavn ruining from Heavn and would have fled
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
Nine dayes they fell; confounded _Chaos_ roard,
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall
Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout
Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last
Yawning receavd them whole, and on them closd,
Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire
Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.
Disburdnd Heavn rejoicd, and soon repaird
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.
Sole Victor from th expulsion of his Foes
_Messiah_ his triumphal Chariot turnd:
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,
With Jubilie advancd; and as they went,
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,
Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion givn,
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode
Triumphant through mid Heavn, into the Courts
And Temple of his mightie Father Thrond
On high; who into Glorie him receavd,
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.

Thus measuring things in Heavn by things on Earth
At thy request, and that thou maist beware
By what is past, to thee I have reveald
What might have else to human Race bin hid;
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heavn
Among th Angelic Powers, and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld
With _Satan_, hee who envies now thy state,
Who now is plotting how he may seduce
Thee also from obedience, that with him
Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake
His punishment, Eternal miserie;
Which would be all his solace and revenge,
As a despite don against the most High,
Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.
But listn not to his Temptations, warne
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard
By terrible Example the reward
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.

       THE END OF THE SIXTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST.





  BOOK VII.

Descend from Heavn _Urania_, by that name
If rightly thou art calld, whose Voice divine
Following, above th _Olympian_ Hill I soare,
Above the flight of _Pegasean_ wing.
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
Of old _Olympus_ dwellst, but Heavnlie borne,
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flowd,
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play
In presence of th Almightie Father, pleasd
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee
Into the Heavn of Heavns I have presumd,
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down
Return me to my Native Element:
Least from this flying Steed unreind, (as once
_Bellerophon_, though from a lower Clime)
Dismounted, on th _Aleian_ Field I fall
Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchangd
To hoarce or mute, though falln on evil dayes,
On evil dayes though falln, and evil tongues;
In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
Visitst my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,
_Urania_, and fit audience find, though few.
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance
Of _Bacchus_ and his Revellers, the Race
Of that wilde Rout that tore the _Thracian_ Bard
In _Rhodope_, where Woods and Rocks had Eares
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:
For thou art Heavnlie, shee an empty dreame.

Say Goddess, what ensud when _Raphael_,
The affable Arch-angel, had forewarnd
_Adam_ by dire example to beware
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven
To those Apostates, least the like befall
In Paradise to _Adam_ or his Race,
Chargd not to touch the interdicted Tree,
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
So easily obeyd amid the choice
Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,
Though wandring.  He with his consorted _Eve_
The storie heard attentive, and was filld
With admiration, and deep Muse to heare
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought
So unimaginable as hate in Heavn,
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss
With such confusion: but the evil soon
Drivn back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
With Blessedness.  Whence _Adam_ soon repeald
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know
What neerer might concern him, how this World
Of Heavn and Earth conspicuous first began,
When, and whereof created, for what cause,
What within _Eden_ or without was done
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayd still eyes the current streame,
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
Proceeded thus to ask his Heavnly Guest.

Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveald
Divine Interpreter, by favour sent
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:
For which to the infinitly Good we owe
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
Receave with solemne purpose to observe
Immutably his sovran will, the end
Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaft
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,
Deign to descend now lower, and relate
What may no less perhaps availe us known,
How first began this Heavn which we behold
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfusd
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause
Movd the Creator in his holy Rest
Through all Eternitie so late to build
In _Chaos_, and the work begun, how soon
Absolvd, if unforbid thou maist unfould
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
To magnifie his works, the more we know.
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heavn
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,
And longer will delay to heare thee tell
His Generation, and the rising Birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.

Thus _Adam_ his illustrous Guest besought:

And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.
This also thy request with caution askt
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
Thy hearing, such Commission from above
I have receavd, to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not reveald, which th invisible King,
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
Anough is left besides to search and know.
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
In measure what the mind may well contain,
Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.

Know then, that after _Lucifer_ from Heavn
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
Into his place, and the great Son returnd
Victorious with his Saints, th Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.

At least our envious Foe hath faild, who thought
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength, the seat
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,
He trusted to have seisd, and into fraud
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,
Thir station, Heavn yet populous retaines
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:
But least his heart exalt him in the harme
Already done, to have dispeopld Heavn,
My damage fondly deemd, I can repaire
That detriment, if such it be to lose
Self-lost, and in a moment will create
Another World, out of one man a Race
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
Not here, till by degrees of merit raisd
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither, under long obedience trid,
And Earth be changd to Heavn, & Heavn to Earth,
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heavn,
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heavn and Earth,
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
Though I uncircumscribd my self retire,
And put not forth my goodness, which is free
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.

So spake th Almightie, and to what he spake
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
Then time or motion, but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told,
So told as earthly notion can receave.
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heavn
When such was heard declard the Almighties will;
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out th ungodly from his sight
And th habitations of the just; to him
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordaind
Good out of evil to create, in stead
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
On his great Expedition now appeerd,
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crownd
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love
Immense, and all his Father in him shon.
About his Chariot numberless were pourd
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wingd,
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodgd
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,
Attendant on thir Lord: Heavn opnd wide
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
On heavnly ground they stood, and from the shore
They viewd the vast immeasurable Abyss
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,
Up from the bottom turnd by furious windes
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
Heavns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.

Silence, ye troubld waves, and thou Deep, peace,
Said then th Omnific Word, your discord end:

Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode
Farr into _Chaos_, and the World unborn;
For _Chaos_ heard his voice: him all his Traine
Followd in bright procession to behold
Creation, and the wonders of his might.
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand
He took the golden Compasses, prepard
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
This Universe, and all created things:
One foot he centerd, and the other turnd
Round through the vast profunditie obscure,
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,
This be thy just Circumference, O World.
Thus God the Heavn created, thus the Earth,
Matter unformd and void: Darkness profound
Coverd th Abyss: but on the watrie calme
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,
And vital vertue infusd, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purgd
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobd
Like things to like, the rest to several place
Disparted, and between spun out the Air,
And Earth self-ballanct on her Center hung.

Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
To journie through the airie gloom began,
Spheard in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle
Sojournd the while.  God saw the Light was good;
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
He namd.  Thus was the first Day Eevn and Morn:
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
Birth-day of Heavn and Earth; with joy and shout
The hollow Universal Orb they filld,
And toucht thir Golden Harps, & hymning praisd
God and his works, Creatour him they sung,
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.

Again, God said, let ther be Firmament
Amid the Waters, and let it divide
The Waters from the Waters: and God made
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffusd
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
The Waters underneath from those above
Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule
Of _Chaos_ farr removd, least fierce extreames
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
And Heavn he namd the Firmament: So Eevn
And Morning _Chorus_ sung the second Day.

The Earth was formd, but in the Womb as yet
Of Waters, Embryon immature involvd,
Appeerd not: over all the face of Earth
Main Ocean flowd, not idle, but with warme
Prolific humour softning all her Globe,
Fermented the great Mother to conceave,
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said
Be gatherd now ye Waters under Heavn
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:
So high as heavd the tumid Hills, so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
For haste; such flight the great command impressd
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;
Easie, ere God had bid the ground be drie,
All but within those banks, where Rivers now
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
Of congregated Waters he calld Seas:
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th Earth
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,
And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadornd,
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flourd
Opning thir various colours, and made gay
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,
Forth flourisht thick the clustring Vine, forth crept
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
Embattelld in her field: add the humble Shrub,
And Bush with frizld hair implicit: last
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemmd
Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,
With tufts the vallies & each fountain side,
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now
Seemd like to Heavn, a seat where Gods might dwell,
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not raind
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each
Plant of the field, which ere it was in the Earth
God made, and every Herb, before it grew
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:
So Eevn and Morn recorded the Third Day.

Again th Almightie spake: Let there be Lights
High in th expanse of Heaven to divide
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heavn
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,
And set them in the Firmament of Heavn
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
A mightie Spheare he framd, unlightsom first,
Though of Ethereal Mould: then formd the Moon
Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,
And sowd with Starrs the Heavn thick as a field:
Of Light by farr the greater part he took,
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and placd
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine
Her gatherd beams, great Palace now of Light.
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs
Repairing, in thir goldn Urns draw Light,
And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;
By tincture or reflection they augment
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight
So farr remote, with diminution seen.
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
Regent of Day, and all th Horizon round
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run
His Longitude through Heavns high rode: the gray
Dawn, and the _Pleiades_ before him dancd
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
But opposite in leveld West was set
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
From him, for other light she needed none
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
Revolvd on Heavns great Axle, and her Reign
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeerd
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day.

And God said, let the Waters generate
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings
Displayd on the opn Firmament of Heavn.
And God created the great Whales, and each
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
The waters generated by thir kindes,
And every Bird of wing after his kinde;
And saw that it was good, and blessd them, saying,
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
And let the Fowle be multiplyd on the Earth.
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
Show to the Sun thir wavd coats dropt with Gold,
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles
Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.
Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares
Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosd
Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge
They summd thir Penns, and soaring th air sublime
With clang despisd the ground, under a cloud
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise
In common, rangd in figure wedge thir way,
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Seas
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire
Floats, as they pass, fannd with unnumberd plumes:
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
Solacd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings
Till Evn, nor then the solemn Nightingal
Ceasd warbling, but all night tund her soft layes:
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bathd
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground
Walkd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours, and th other whose gay Traine
Adorns him, colourd with the Florid hue
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,
Evning and Morn solemnizd the Fift day.

The Sixt, and of Creation last arose
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,
Let th Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
Each in their kinde.  The Earth obeyd, and strait
Opning her fertil Woomb teemd at a Birth
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,
Limbd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walkd:
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:
The grassie Clods now Calvd, now half appeerd
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale
Rising, the crumbld Earth above them threw
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould
_Behemoth_ biggest born of Earth upheavd
His vastness: Fleect the Flocks and bleating rose,
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
Insect or Worme; those wavd thir limber fans
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
These as a line thir long dimension drew,
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde
Wondrous in length and corpulence involvd
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
Of future, in small room large heart enclosd,
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps
Hereafter, joind in her popular Tribes
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeerd
The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
With Honey stord: the rest are numberless,
And thou thir Natures knowst, and gavst them Names,
Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown
The Serpent suttlst Beast of all the field,
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
Now Heavn in all her Glorie shon, and rowld
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovly smild; Aire, Water, Earth,
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remaind;
There wanted yet the Master work, the end
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
And Brute as other Creatures, but endud
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect
His Stature, and upright with Front serene
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heavn,
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in Devotion, to adore
And worship God Supream, who made him chief
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father (For where is not hee
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.

Let us make now Man in our image, Man
In our similitude, and let them rule
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
This said, he formd thee, _Adam_, thee O Man
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathd
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee
Created thee, in the Image of God
Express, and thou becamst a living Soul.
Male he created thee, but thy consort
Femal for Race; then blessd Mankinde, and said,
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
Wherever thus created, for no place
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowst
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
Delectable both to behold and taste;
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th Earth yeelds,
Varietie without end; but of the Tree
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
Thou maist not; in the day thou eatst, thou dist;
Death is the penaltie imposd, beware,
And govern well thy appetite, least sin
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
Here finishd hee, and all that he had made
Viewd, and behold all was entirely good;
So Evn and Morn accomplishd the Sixt day:
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd
Up to the Heavn of Heavns his high abode,
Thence to behold this new created World
Th addition of his Empire, how it shewd
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode
Followd with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tund
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire
Resounded, (thou rememberst, for thou heardst)
The Heavns and all the Constellations rung,
The Planets in thir stations listning stood,
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,
Open, ye Heavns, your living dores; let in
The great Creator from his work returnd
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged Messengers
On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heavn,
That opend wide her blazing Portals, led
To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest
Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh
Eevning arose in _Eden_, for the Sun
Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
Of Heavns high-seated top, th Impereal Throne
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,
The Filial Power arrivd, and sate him down
With his great Father (for he also went
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordaind,
Author and end of all things, and from work
Now resting, blessd and hallowd the Seavnth day,
As resting on that day from all his work,
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
Temperd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,
Great are thy works, _Jehovah_, infinite
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee; greater now in thy return
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
Thy Thunders magnifid; but to create
Is greater then created to destroy.
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might: his evil
Thou usest, and from thence creatst more good.
Witness this new-made World, another Heavn
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view
On the cleer _Hyaline_, the Glassie Sea;
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starrs
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World
Of destind habitation; but thou knowst
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfusd,
Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanct,
Created in his Image, there to dwell
And worship him, and in reward to rule
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
And multiply a Race of Worshippers
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know
Thir happiness, and persevere upright.

So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,
With _Halleluiahs_: Thus was Sabbath kept.
And thy request think now fulfilld, that askd
How first this World and face of things began,
And what before thy memorie was don
From the beginning, that posteritie
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

To whom thus _Adam_ gratefully replid.
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee, Divine
Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaft
This friendly condescention to relate
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard
VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
With glorie attributed to the high
Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,
VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.
VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld
Of Heavn and Earth consisting, and compute,
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,
An Atom, with the Firmament compard
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle
Spaces incomprehensible (for such
Thir distance argues and thir swift return
Diurnal) meerly to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
One day and night; in all thir vast survey
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
So many nobler Bodies to create,
Greater so manifold to this one use,
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,
That better might with farr less compass move,
Servd by more noble then her self, attaines
Her end without least motion, and receaves,
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.

So spake our Sire, and by his countnance seemd
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which _Eve_
Perceaving where she sat retird in sight,
With lowliness Majestic from her seat,
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,
To visit how they prosperd, bud and bloom,
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
Delighted, or not capable her eare
Of what was high: such pleasure she reservd,
_Adam_ relating, she sole Auditress;
Her Husband the Relater she preferrd
Before the Angel, and of him to ask
Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip
Not Words alone pleasd her.  O when meet now
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joynd?
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;
Not unattended, for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
And from about her shot Darts of desire
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.
And _Raphael_ now to _Adam_s doubt proposd
Benevolent and facil thus replid.

To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heavn
Is as the Book of God before thee set,
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne
His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:
This to attain, whether Heavn move or Earth,
Imports not, if thou reckn right, the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
His secrets to be scannd by them who ought
Rather admire; or if they list to try
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heavns
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide
Hereafter, when they come to model Heavn
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear
With Centric and Eccentric scribld ore,
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest
That Bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright, nor Heavn such journies run,
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves
The benefit: consider first, that Great
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth
Though, in comparison of Heavn, so small,
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd
His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.
And for the Heavns wide Circuit, let it speak
The Makers high magnificence, who built
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;
That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
An Edifice too large for him to fill,
Lodgd in a small partition, and the rest
Ordaind for uses to his Lord best known.
The swiftness of those Circles attribute,
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
That to corporeal substances could adde
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heavn
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrivd
In _Eden_, distance inexpressible
By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,
Admitting Motion in the Heavns, to shew
Invalid that which thee to doubt it movd;
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
God to remove his wayes from human sense,
Placd Heavn from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,
If it presume, might erre in things too high,
And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs
By his attractive vertue and thir own
Incited, dance about him various rounds?
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,
In six thou seest, and what if sevnth to these
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,
Insensibly three different Motions move?
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,
Movd contrarie with thwart obliquities,
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb supposd,
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day
Travelling East, and with her part averse
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part
Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce
Fruits in her softnd Soile, for some to eate
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie
Communicating Male and Femal Light,
Which two great Sexes animate the World,
Stord in each Orb perhaps with some that live.
For such vast room in Nature unpossest
By living Soule, desert and desolate,
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr
Down to this habitable, which returnes
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
But whether thus these things, or whether not,
Whether the Sun predominant in Heavn
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,
Or Shee from West her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eevn,
And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,
Wherever plact, let him dispose: joy thou
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
And thy faire _Eve_; Heavn is for thee too high
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there
Live, in what state, condition or degree,
Contented that thus farr hath been reveald
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heavn.

To whom thus _Adam_ cleerd of doubt, replid.
How fully hast thou satisfid mee, pure
Intelligence of Heavn, Angel serene,
And freed from intricacies, taught to live,
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,
And not molest us, unless we our selves
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;
Till warnd, or by experience taught, she learne,
That not to know at large of things remote
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know
That which before us lies in daily life,
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,
And renders us in things that most concerne
Unpractisd, unprepard, and still to seek.
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand
Useful, whence haply mention may arise
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deignd.
Thee I have heard relating what was don
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest
How suttly to detaine thee I devise,
Inviting thee to hear while I relate,
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heavn,
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine
Imbud, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.

To whom thus _Raphael_ answerd heavnly meek.
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also pourd,
Inward and outward both, his image faire:
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.
Nor less think wee in Heavn of thee on Earth
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:
For God we see hath honourd thee, and set
On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;
For I that Day was absent, as befell,
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;
Squard in full Legion (such command we had)
To see that none thence issud forth a spie,
Or enemie, while God was in his work,
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,
Destruction with Creation might have mixt.
Not that they durst without his leave attempt,
But us he sends upon his high behests
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure
Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut
The dismal Gates, and barricadod strong;
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,
Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.
Glad we returnd up to the coasts of Light
Ere Sabbath Eevning: so we had in charge.
But thy relation now; for I attend,
Pleasd with thy words no less then thou with mine.

So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
For Man to tell how human Life began
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?
Desire with thee still longer to converse
Inducd me.  As new wakt from soundest sleep
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun
Soon drid, and on the reaking moisture fed.
Strait toward Heavn my wondring Eyes I turnd,
And gazd a while the ample Skie, till raisd
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,
As thitherward endevoring, and upright
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walkd, or flew,
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smild,
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflowd.
My self I then perusd, and Limb by Limb
Surveyd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
But who I was, or where, or from what cause,
Knew not; to speak I trid, and forthwith spake,
My Tongue obeyd and readily could name
What ere I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,
And thou enlightnd Earth, so fresh and gay,
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?
Not of my self; by some great Maker then,
In goodness and in power praeeminent;
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
From whom I have that thus I move and live,
And feel that I am happier then I know.
While thus I calld, and strayd I knew not whither,
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld
This happie Light, when answer none returnd,
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep
First found me, and with soft oppression seisd
My droused sense, untroubld, though I thought
I then was passing to my former state
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,
Whose inward apparition gently movd
My Fancy to believe I yet had being,
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, _Adam_, rise,
First Man, of Men innumerable ordaind
First Father, calld by thee I come thy Guide
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepard.
So saying, by the hand he took me raisd,
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,
A Circuit wide, enclosd, with goodliest Trees
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw
Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree
Loadn with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye
Tempting, stirrd in me sudden appetite
To pluck and eate; whereat I wakd, and found
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide
Up hither, from among the Trees appeerd,
Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw
In adoration at his feet I fell
Submiss: he reard me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest
Above, or round about thee or beneath.
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
But of the Tree whose operation brings
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,
And shun the bitter consequence: for know,
The day thou eatst thereof, my sole command
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;
From that day mortal, and this happie State
Shalt loose, expelld from hence into a World
Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronouncd
The rigid interdiction, which resounds
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect
Returnd and gratious purpose thus renewd.
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords
Possess it, and all things that therein live,
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie
With low subjection; understand the same
Of Fish within thir watry residence,
Not hither summond, since they cannot change
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold
Approaching two and two, These cowring low
With blandishment, each Bird stoopd on his wing.
I namd them, as they passd, and understood
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endud
My sudden apprehension: but in these
I found not what me thought I wanted still;
And to the Heavnly vision thus presumd.

O by what Name, for thou above all these,
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I
Adore thee, Author of this Universe,
And all this good to man, for whose well being
So amply, and with hands so liberal
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee
I see not who partakes.  In solitude
What happiness, who can enjoy alone,
Or all enjoying, what contentment find?
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,
As with a smile more brightnd, thus replid.

What callst thou solitude, is not the Earth
With various living creatures, and the Aire
Replenisht, and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee, knowst thou not
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,
And reason not contemptibly; with these
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.
So spake the Universal Lord, and seemd
So ordering.  I with leave of speech implord,
And humble deprecation thus replid.

Let not my words offend thee, Heavnly Power,
My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
And these inferiour farr beneath me set?
Among unequals what societie
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?
Which must be mutual, in proportion due
Givn and receivd; but in disparitie
The one intense, the other still remiss
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak
Such as I seek, fit to participate
All rational delight, wherein the brute
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combind;
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.

Whereto th Almighty answerd, not displeasd.
A nice and suttle happiness I see
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice
Of thy Associates, _Adam_, and wilt taste
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest
Of happiness, or not? who am alone
From all Eternitie, for none I know
Second to mee or like, equal much less.
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those
To me inferiour, infinite descents
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?

He ceasd, I lowly answerd.  To attaine
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee
Is no deficience found; not so is Man,
But in degree, the cause of his desire
By conversation with his like to help,
Or solace his defects.  No need that thou
Shouldst propagat, already infinite;
And through all numbers absolute, though One;
But Man by number is to manifest
His single imperfection, and beget
Like of his like, his Image multiplid,
In unitie defective, which requires
Collateral love, and deerest amitie.
Thou in thy secresie although alone,
Best with thy self accompanied, seekst not
Social communication, yet so pleasd,
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt
Of Union or Communion, deifid;
I by conversing cannot these erect
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.
Thus I emboldnd spake, and freedom usd
Permissive, and acceptance found, which gaind
This answer from the gratious voice Divine.

Thus farr to try thee, _Adam_, I was pleasd,
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,
Which thou hast rightly namd, but of thy self,
Expressing well the spirit within thee free,
My Image, not imparted to the Brute,
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spakst,
Knew it not good for Man to be alone,
And no such companie as then thou sawst
Intended thee, for trial onely brought,
To see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet:
What next I bring shall please thee, be assurd,
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,
Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.

Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now
My earthly by his Heavnly overpowerd,
Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth
In that celestial Colloquie sublime,
As with an object that excels the sense,
Dazld and spent, sunk down, and sought repair
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, calld
By Nature as in aide, and closd mine eyes.
Mine eyes he closd, but opn left the Cell
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape
Still glorious before whom awake I stood;
Who stooping opnd my left side, and took
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,
But suddenly with flesh filld up & heald:
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;
Under his forming hands a Creature grew,
Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd
And in her looks, which from that time infusd
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,
And into all things from her Aire inspird
The spirit of love and amorous delight.
She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wakd
To find her, or for ever to deplore
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable: On she came,
Led by her Heavnly Maker, though unseen,
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:
Grace was in all her steps, Heavn in her Eye,
In every gesture dignitie and love.
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.

This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilld
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.

She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,
That would be wood, and not unsought be won,
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retird,
The more desirable, or to say all,
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turnd;
I followd her, she what was Honour knew,
And with obsequious Majestie approvd
My pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heavn,
And happie Constellations on that houre
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires
Whisperd it to the Woods, and from thir wings
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr
On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.
Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought
My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find
In all things else delight indeed, but such
As usd or not, works in the mind no change,
Nor vehement desire, these delicacies
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours,
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here
Farr otherwise, transported I behold,
Transported touch; here passion first I felt,
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else
Superiour and unmovd, here onely weake
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part
Not proof enough such Object to sustain,
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps
More then enough; at least on her bestowd
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew
Elaborate, of inward less exact.
For well I understand in the prime end
Of Nature her th inferiour, in the mind
And inward Faculties, which most excell,
In outward also her resembling less
His Image who made both, and less expressing
The character of that Dominion givn
Ore other Creatures; yet when I approach
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
And in her self compleat, so well to know
Her own, that what she wills to do or say,
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her
Looses discountnanct, and like folly shewes;
Authoritie and Reason on her waite,
As one intended first, not after made
Occasionally; and to consummate all,
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
About her, as a guard Angelic plact.
To whom the Angel with contracted brow.

Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,
By attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent, as thou thy self perceavst.
For what admirst thou, what transports thee so,
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;
Then value: Oft times nothing profits more
Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right
Well managd; of that skill the more thou knowst,
The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,
And to realities yeild all her shows;
Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
So awful, that with honour thou maist love
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other, think the same voutsaft
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be
To them made common & divulgd, if aught
Therein enjoyd were worthy to subdue
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.
What higher in her societie thou findst
Attractive, human, rational, love still;
In loving thou dost well, in passion not,
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale
By which to heavnly Love thou maist ascend,
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.

To whom thus half abasht _Adam_ replid.
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught
In procreation common to all kindes
(Though higher of the genial Bed by far,
And with mysterious reverence I deem)
So much delights me, as those graceful acts,
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions, mixt with Love
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeignd
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,
Who meet with various objects, from the sense
Variously representing; yet still free
Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
To love thou blamst me not, for love thou saist
Leads up to Heavn, is both the way and guide;
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;
Love not the heavnly Spirits, and how thir Love
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?

To whom the Angel with a smile that glowd
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,
Answerd.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowst
Us happie, and without Love no happiness.
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyst
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
In eminence, and obstacle find none
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:
Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure
Desiring; nor restraind conveyance need
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.
But I can now no more; the parting Sun
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
_Hesperean_ sets, my Signal to depart.
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep
His great command; take heed least Passion sway
Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons
The weal or woe in thee is plact; beware.
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.
Perfet within, no outward aid require;
And all temptation to transgress repel.

So saying, he arose; whom _Adam_ thus
Followd with benediction.  Since to part,
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension, and shall be honourd ever
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still, and oft return.

So parted they, the Angel up to Heavn
From the thick shade, and _Adam_ to his Bowre.

       THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK VIII.

No more of talk where God or Angel Guest
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar usd
To sit indulgent, and with him partake
Rural repast, permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamd: I now must change
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt
And disobedience: On the part of Heavn
Now alienated, distance and distaste,
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement givn,
That brought into this World a world of woe,
Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument
Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth
Of stern _Achilles_ on his Foe pursud
Thrice Fugitive about _Troy_ Wall; or rage
Of _Turnus_ for _Lavinia_ disespousd,
Or _Neptuns_ ire or _Junos_, that so long
Perplexd the _Greek_ and _Cythereas_ Son;
If answerable style I can obtaine
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes
Her nightly visitation unimplord,
And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires
Easie my unpremeditated Verse:
Since first this subject for Heroic Song
Pleasd me long choosing, and beginning late;
Not sedulous by Nature to indite
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument
Heroic deemd, chief maistrie to dissect
With long and tedious havoc fabld Knights
In Battels feignd; the better fortitude
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
Or tilting Furniture, emblazond Shields,
Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights
At Joust and Torneament; then marshald Feast
Servd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
Not that which justly gives Heroic name
To Person or to Poem.  Mee of these
Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument
Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise
That name, unless an age too late, or cold
Climat, or Years damp my intended wing
Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.

The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr
Of _Hesperus_, whose Office is to bring
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:
When _Satan_ who late fled before the threats
Of _Gabriel_ out of _Eden_, now improvd
In meditated fraud and malice, bent
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself, fearless returnd.
By Night he fled, and at Midnight returnd
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
Since _Uriel_ Regent of the Sun descrid
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish drivn,
The space of seven continud Nights he rode
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
He circld, four times crossd the Carr of Night
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
On the eighth returnd, and on the Coast averse
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,
Where _Tigris_ at the foot of Paradise
Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
In with the River sunk, and with it rose
Satan involvd in rising Mist, then sought
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land
From _Eden_ over _Pontus_, and the Poole
_Maeotis_, up beyond the River _Ob_;
Downward as farr Antartic; and in length
West from _Orantes_ to the Ocean barrd
At _Darien_, thence to the Land where flowes
_Ganges_ and _Indus:_ thus the Orb he roamd
With narrow search; and with inspection deep
Considerd every Creature, which of all
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.
Him after long debate, irresolute
Of thoughts revolvd, his final sentence chose
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,
As from his wit and native suttletie
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observd
Doubt might beget of Diabolic powr
Active within beyond the sense of brute.
Thus he resolvd, but first from inward griefe
His bursting passion into plaints thus pourd:

O Earth, how like to Heavn, if not preferrd
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heavn, danct round by other Heavns
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,
In thee concentring all thir precious beams
Of sacred influence: As God in Heavn
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou
Centring receavst from all those Orbs; in thee,
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth
Of Creatures animate with gradual life
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summd up in Man.
With what delight could I have walkt thee round
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,
Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these
Find place or refuge; and the more I see
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
Of contraries; all good to me becomes
Bane, and in Heavn much worse would be my state.
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heavn
To dwell, unless by maistring Heavns Supreame;
Nor hope to be my self less miserable
By what I seek, but others to make such
As I though thereby worse to me redound:
For onely in destroying I finde ease
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,
Or won to what may work his utter loss,
For whom all this was made, all this will soon
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,
In wo then; that destruction wide may range:
To mee shall be the glorie sole among
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marrd
What he _Almightie_ styld, six Nights and Days
Continud making, and who knows how long
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps
Not longer then since I in one Night freed
From servitude inglorious welnigh half
Th Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng
Of his adorers: hee to be avengd,
And to repaire his numbers thus impaird,
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild
More Angels to Create, if they at least
Are his Created or to spite us more,
Determind to advance into our room
A Creature formd of Earth, and him endow,
Exalted from so base original,
With Heavnly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed
He effected; Man he made, and for him built
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,
Him Lord pronouncd, and, O indignitie!
Subjected to his service Angel wings,
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend
Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
O foul descent! that I who erst contended
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind
Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,
This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
That to the hight of Deitie aspird;
But what will not Ambition and Revenge
Descend to? who aspires must down as low
As high he soard, obnoxious first or last
To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,
Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimd,
Since higher I fall short, on him who next
Provokes my envie, this new Favorite
Of Heavn, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,
Whom us the more to spite his Maker raisd
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.

So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
His midnight search, where soonest he might finde
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,
His head the midst, well stord with suttle wiles:
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,
In heart or head, possessing soon inspird
With act intelligential; but his sleep
Disturbd not, waiting close th approach of Morn.
Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne
In _Eden_ on the humid Flours, that breathd
Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,
From th Earths great Altar send up silent praise
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair
And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.
And _Eve_ first to her Husband thus began.

_Adam_, well may we labour still to dress
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.
Our pleasant task enjoynd, but till more hands
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise
Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct
The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:
For while so near each other thus all day
Our task we choose, what wonder if no near
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits
Our dayes work brought to little, though begun
Early, and th hour of Supper comes unearnd.

To whom mild answer _Adam_ thus returnd.
Sole _Eve_, Associate sole, to me beyond
Compare above all living Creatures deare,
Well hast thou motiond, wel thy thoughts imployd
How we might best fulfill the work which here
God hath assignd us, nor of me shalt pass
Unpraisd: for nothing lovelier can be found
In woman, then to studie houshold good,
And good workes in her Husband to promote.
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposd
Labour, as to debarr us when we need
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,
To brute denid, and are of Love the food,
Love not the lowest end of human life.
For not to irksom toile, but to delight
He made us, and delight to Reason joynd.
These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.
For solitude somtimes is best societie,
And short retirement urges sweet returne.
But other doubt possesses me, least harm
Befall thee severd from me; for thou knowst
What hath bin warnd us, what malicious Foe
Envying our happiness, and of his own
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each
To other speedie aide might lend at need;
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss
Enjoyd by us excites his envie more;
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.

To whom the Virgin Majestie of _Eve_,
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
With sweet austeer composure thus replyd.

Ofspring of Heavn and Earth, and all Earths Lord,
That such an enemie we have, who seeks
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,
And from the parting Angel over-heard
As in a shadie nook I stood behind,
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
To God or thee, because we have a foe
May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
His violence thou fearst not, being such,
As wee, not capable of death or paine,
Can either not receave, or can repell.
His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs
Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love
Can by his fraud be shakn or seduct;
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,
_Adam_, misthought of her to thee so dear?

To whom with healing words _Adam_ replyd.
Daughter of God and Man, immortal _Eve_,
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
Th attempt it self, intended by our Foe.
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
The tempted with dishonour foul, supposd
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne
And anger wouldst resent the offerd wrong,
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
If such affront I labour to avert
From thee alone, which on us both at once
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,
Or daring, first on mee th assault shall light.
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.
I from the influence of thy looks receave
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
Shame to be overcome or over-reacht
Would utmost vigor raise, and raisd unite.
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
When I am present, and thy trial choose
With me, best witness of thy Vertue trid.

So spake domestick _Adam_ in his care
And Matrimonial Love, but _Eve_, who thought
Less attributed to her Faith sincere,
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.

If this be our condition, thus to dwell
In narrow circuit straitnd by a Foe,
Suttle or violent, we not endud
Single with like defence, wherever met,
How are we happie, still in fear of harm?
But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme
Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns
Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard
By us? who rather double honour gaine
From his surmise provd false, finde peace within,
Favour from Heavn, our witness from th event.
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid
Alone, without exterior help sustaind?
Let us not then suspect our happie State
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,
As not secure to single or combind.
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,
And _Eden_ were no _Eden_ thus exposd.

To whom thus _Adam_ fervently replid.
O Woman, best are all things as the will
Of God ordaind them, his creating hand
Nothing imperfet or deficient left
Of all that he Created, much less Man,
Or ought that might his happie State secure,
Secure from outward force; within himself
The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
Against his will he can receave no harme.
But God left free the Will, for what obeyes
Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,
But bid her well beware, and still erect,
Least by some faire appeering good surprisd
She dictate false, and missinforme the Will
To do what God expresly hath forbid.
Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,
That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the Foe subornd,
And fall into deception unaware,
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.
Seek not temptation then, which to avoide
Were better, and most likelie if from mee
Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.
Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve
First thy obedience; th other who can know,
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
But if thou think, trial unsought may finde
Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
Go in thy native innocence, relie
On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.

So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but _Eve_
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, replid.

With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,
May finde us both perhaps farr less prepard,
The willinger I goe, nor much expect
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light
_Oread_ or _Dryad_, or of _Delias_ Traine,
Betook her to the Groves, but _Delias_ self
In gate surpassd and Goddess-like deport,
Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,
But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,
Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,
To _Pales_, or _Pomona_, thus adornd,
Likest she seemd, _Pomona_ when she fled
_Vertumnus_, or to _Ceres_ in her Prime,
Yet Virgin of _Proserpina_ from _Jove_.
Her long with ardent look his _Eye_ pursud
Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,
Repeated, shee to him as oft engagd
To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.
O much deceavd, much failing, hapless _Eve_,
Of thy presumd return! event perverse!
Thou never from that houre in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose;
Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades
Waited with hellish rancor imminent
To intercept thy way, or send thee back
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them
The whole included Race, his purposd prey.
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet
He sought them both, but wishd his hap might find
_Eve_ separate, he wishd, but not with hope
Of what so seldom chancd, when to his wish,
Beyond his hope, _Eve_ separate he spies,
Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,
Half spid, so thick the Roses bushing round
About her glowd, oft stooping to support
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,
Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,
From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.
Neererhe drew, and many a walk traversd
Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen
Among thick-wovn Arborets and Flours
Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of _Eve_:
Spot more delicious then those Gardens feignd
Or of revivd _Adonis_, or renownd
_Alcinous_, host of old _Laertes_ Son,
Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King
Held dalliance with his faire _Egyptian_ Spouse.
Much hee the Place admird, the Person more.
As one who long in populous City pent,
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,
She most, and in her look summs all Delight.
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of _Eve_
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heavnly forme
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,
Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire
Of gesture or lest action overawd
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereavd
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
That space the Evil one abstracted stood
From his own evil, and for the time remaind
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarmd,
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,
Though in mid Heavn, soon ended his delight,
And tortures him now more, the more he sees
Of pleasure not for him ordaind: then soon
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.

Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet
Compulsion thus transported to forget
What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,
Save what is in destroying, other joy
To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass
Occasion which now smiles, behold alone
The Woman, opportune to all attempts,
Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,
I not; so much hath Hell debasd, and paine
Infeebld me, to what I was in Heavn.
Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,
Not terrible, though terrour be in Love
And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,
Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feignd,
The way which to her ruin now I tend.

So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclosd
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward _Eve_
Addressd his way, not with indented wave,
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,
Circular base of rising foulds, that tourd
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
Lovelier, not those that in _Illyria_ changd
_Hermione_ and _Cadmus_, or the God
In _Epidaurus_; nor to which transformd
_Ammonian Jove_, or _Capitoline_ was seen,
Hee with _Olympias_, this with her who bore
_Scipio_ the highth of _Rome_.  With tract oblique
At first, as one who sought access, but feard
To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;
So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of _Eve_,
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as usd
To such disport before her through the Field,
From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
Then at _Circean_ call the Herd disguisd.
Hee boulder now, uncalld before her stood;
But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd
His turret Crest, and sleek enameld Neck,
Fawning, and lickd the ground whereon she trod.
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length
The Eye of _Eve_ to mark his play; he glad
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,
His fraudulent temptation thus began.

Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm
Thy looks, the Heavn of mildness, with disdain,
Displeasd that I approach thee thus, and gaze
Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retird.
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,
Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore
With ravishment beheld, there best beheld
Where universally admird; but here
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne
Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen
A Goddess among Gods, adord and servd
By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.

So glozd the Tempter, and his Proem tund;
Into the Heart of _Eve_ his words made way,
Though at the voice much marveling; at length
Not unamazd she thus in answer spake.
What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounct
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?
The first at lest of these I thought denid
To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day
Created mute to all articulat sound;
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field
I knew, but not with human voice endud;
Redouble then this miracle, and say,
How camst thou speakable of mute, and how
To me so friendly grown above the rest
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
Say, for such wonder claims attention due.

To whom the guileful Tempter thus replyd.
Empress of this fair World, resplendent _Eve_,
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:
I was at first as other Beasts that graze
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,
As was my food, nor aught but food discernd
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:
Till on a day roaving the field, I chancd
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
When from the boughes a savorie odour blown,
Grateful to appetite, more pleasd my sense
Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.
To satisfie the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolvd
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,
Powerful perswaders, quicknd at the scent
Of that alluring fruit, urgd me so keene.
About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,
For high from ground the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or _Adams_: Round the Tree
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
I spard not, for such pleasure till that hour
At Feed or Fountain never had I found.
Sated at length, ere long I might perceave
Strange alteration in me, to degree
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech
Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind
Considerd all things visible in Heavn,
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;
But all that fair and good in thy Divine
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heavnly Ray
United I beheld; no Fair to thine
Equivalent or second, which compeld
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come
And gaze, and worship thee of right declard
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.

So talkd the spirited sly Snake; and _Eve_
Yet more amazd unwarie thus replyd.

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first provd:
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?
For many are the Trees of God that grow
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
To us, in such abundance lies our choice,
As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,
Still hanging incorruptible, till men
Grow up to thir provision, and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.

To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.
Empress, the way is readie, and not long,
Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,
Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past
Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.

Lead then, said _Eve_.  Hee leading swiftly rowld
In tangles, and make intricate seem strait,
To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy
Brightns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire
Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night
Condenses, and the cold invirons round,
Kindld through agitation to a Flame,
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,
Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,
Misleads th amazd Night-wanderer from his way
To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole,
There swallowd up and lost, from succour farr.
So glisterd the dire Snake and into fraud
Led _Eve_ our credulous Mother, to the Tree
Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.

Serpent, we might have spard our coming hither,
Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,
The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,
Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.
But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;
God so commanded, and left that Command
Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.

To whom the Tempter guilefully replid.
Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit
Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,
Yet Lords declard of all in Earth or Aire?

To whom thus _Eve_ yet sinless.  Of the Fruit
Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,
But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst
The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate
Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.

She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold
The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love
To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
New part puts on, and as to passion movd,
Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act
Raisd, as of som great matter to begin.
As when of old som Orator renound
In _Athens_ or free _Rome_, where Eloquence
Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,
Stood in himself collected, while each part,
Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,
Somtimes in highth began, as no delay
Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown
The Tempter all impassiond thus began.

O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life
To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,
Mee who have touchd and tasted, yet both live,
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
Is open? or will God incense his ire
For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain
Of Death denounct, whatever thing Death be,
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:
Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,
His worshippers; he knows that in the day
Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then
Opnd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,
Internal Man, is but proportion meet,
I of brute human, yee of human Gods.
So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off
Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,
Though threatnd, which no worse then this can bring
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they, participating God-like food?
The Gods are first, and that advantage use
On our belief, that all from them proceeds,
I question it, for this fair Earth I see,
Warmd by the Sun, producing every kind,
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclosd
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
Th offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree
Impart against his will if all be his?
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell
In heavnly brests? these, these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.

He ended, and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easie entrance won:
Fixt on the Fruit she gazd, which to behold
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregnd
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;
Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wakd
An eager appetite, raisd by the smell
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first
Pausing a while, thus to her self she musd.

Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,
Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admird,
Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:
Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,
Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding
Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good
By thee communicated, and our want:
For good unknown, sure is not had, or had
And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.
How dies the Serpent? hee hath eatn and lives,
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,
Irrational till then.  For us alone
Was death invented? or to us denid
This intellectual food, for beasts reservd?
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy
The good befalln him, Author unsuspect,
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.
What fear I then, rather what know to feare
Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluckd, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,
That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for _Eve_
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true
Or fansied so, through expectation high
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.
Greedily she ingorgd without restraint,
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,
And hightnd as with Wine, jocond and boon,
Thus to her self she pleasingly began.

O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees
In Paradise, of operation blest
To Sapience, hitherto obscurd, infamd,
And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end
Created; but henceforth my early care,
Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise
Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease
Of thy full branches offerd free to all;
Till dieted by thee I grow mature
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;
Though others envie what they cannot give;
For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here
Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,
Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind
In ignorance, thou opnst Wisdoms way,
And givst access, though secret she retire.
And I perhaps am secret; Heavn is high,
High and remote to see from thence distinct
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
May have diverted from continual watch
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies
About him.  But to _Adam_ in what sort
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known
As yet my change, and give him to partake
Full happiness with mee, or rather not,
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power
Without Copartner? so to add what wants
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,
And render me more equal, and perhaps
A thing not undesireable, somtime
Superior; for inferior who is free?
This may be well: but what if God have seen,
And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,
And _Adam_ wedded to another _Eve_,
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
A death to think.  Confirmd then I resolve,
_Adam_ shall share with me in bliss or woe:
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
I could endure; without him live no life.

So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,
But first low Reverence don, as to the power
That dwelt within, whose presence had infusd
Into the plant sciential sap, derivd
From Nectar, drink of Gods.  _Adam_ the while
Waiting desirous her return, had wove
Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne
Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown
As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.
Great joy he promisd to his thoughts, and new
Solace in her return, so long delayd;
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;
And forth to meet her went, the way she took
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smild,
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffusd.
To him she hasted, in her face excuse
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,
Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.

Hast thou not wonderd, _Adam_, at my stay?
Thee I have misst, and thought it long, deprivd
Thy presence, agonie of love till now
Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more
Mean I to trie, what rash untrid I sought,
The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
Opning the way, but of Divine effect
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,
Hath eatn of the fruit, and is become,
Not dead, as we are threatnd, but thenceforth
Endud with human voice and human sense,
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I
Have also tasted, and have also found
Th effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,
Tedious, unshard with thee, and odious soon.
Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot
May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;
Least thou not tasting, different degree
Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce
Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.

Thus _Eve_ with Countnance blithe her storie told;
But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.
On th other side, _Adam_, soon as he heard
The fatal Trespass don by _Eve_, amazd,
Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill
Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relaxd;
From his slack hand the Garland wreathd for _Eve_
Down dropd, and all the faded Roses shed:
Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
First to himself he inward silence broke.

O fairest of Creation, last and best
Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excelld
Whatever can to fight or thought be found,
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,
Defact, deflourd, and now to Death devote?
Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
The strict forbiddance, how to violate
The sacred Fruit forbiddn! som cursed fraud
Of Enemie hath beguild thee, yet unknown,
And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee
Certain my resolution is to Die;
How can I live without thee, how forgoe
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joynd,
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?
Should God create another _Eve_, and I
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.

So having said, as one from sad dismay
Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd
Submitting to what seemd remediless,
Thus in calme mood his Words to _Eve_ he turnd.

Bold deed thou hast presumd, adventrous _Eve_,
And peril great provokt, who thus hast dard
Had it bin onely coveting to Eye
That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,
Much more to taste it under banne to touch.
But past who can recall, or don undoe?
Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact
Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,
Profand first by the Serpent, by him first
Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;
Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,
Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man
Higher degree of Life, inducement strong
To us, as likely tasting to attaine
Proportional ascent, which cannot be
But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime Creatures, dignifid so high,
Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,
For us created, needs with us must faile,
Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,
Not well conceavd of God, who though his Power
Creation could repeate, yet would be loath
Us to abolish, least the Adversary
Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God
Most Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first
He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?
Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.
However I with thee have fixt my Lot,
Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death
Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;
So forcible within my heart I feel
The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
Our State cannot be severd, we are one,
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.

So _Adam_, and thus _Eve_ to him replid.
O glorious trial of exceeding Love,
Illustrious evidence, example high!
Ingaging me to emulate, but short
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,
_Adam_, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,
Direct, or by occasion hath presented
This happie trial of thy Love, which else
So eminently never had bin known.
Were it I thought Death menact would ensue
This my attempt, I would sustain alone
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assurd
Remarkably so late of thy so true,
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel
Farr otherwise th event, not Death, but Life
Augmented, opnd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
On my experience, _Adam_, freely taste,
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.

So saying, she embracd him, and for joy
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love
Had so enobld, as of choice to incurr
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.
In recompence (for such compliance bad
Such recompence best merits) from the bough
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit
With liberal hand: he scrupld not to eat
Against his better knowledge, not deceavd,
But fondly overcome with Femal charm.
Earth trembld from her entrails, as again
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,
Skie lowrd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin
Original; while _Adam_ took no thought,
Eating his fill, nor _Eve_ to iterate
Her former trespass feard, the more to soothe
Him with her lovd societie, that now
As with new Wine intoxicated both
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel
Divinitie within them breeding wings
Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit
Farr other operation first displaid,
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on _Eve_
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:
Till _Adam_ thus gan _Eve_ to dalliance move.

_Eve_, now I see thou art exact of taste,
And elegant, of Sapience no small part,
Since to each meaning savour we apply,
And Palate call judicious; I the praise
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purveyd.
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstaind
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now
True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
In things to us forbidden, it might be wishd,
For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.
But come, so well refresht, now let us play,
As meet is, after such delicious Fare;
For never did thy Beautie since the day
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adornd
With all perfections, so enflame my sense
With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now
Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.

So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
Of amorous intent, well understood
Of _Eve_, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.
Her hand he seisd, and to a shadie bank,
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowrd
He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,
Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,
And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.
There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport
Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,
The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep
Oppressd them, wearied with thir amorous play.
Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,
That with exhilerating vapour bland
About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers
Made erre, was now exhald, and grosser sleep
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose
As from unrest, and each the other viewing,
Soon found thir Eyes how opnd, and thir minds
How darknd; innocence, that as a veile
Had shadowd them from knowing ill, was gon,
Just confidence, and native righteousness,
And honour from about them, naked left
To guiltie shame hee coverd, but his Robe
Uncoverd more.  So rose the _Danite_ strong
_Herculean Samson_ from the Harlot-lap
Of _Philistean Dalilah_, and wakd
Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare
Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face
Confounded long they sate, as struckn mute,
Till _Adam_, though not less then _Eve_ abasht,
At length gave utterance to these words constraind.

O _Eve_, in evil hour thou didst give care
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught
To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,
False in our promisd Rising; since our Eyes
Opnd we find indeed, and find we know
Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,
Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,
Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,
Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,
And in our Faces evident the signes
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face
Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy
And rapture so oft beheld? those heavnly shapes
Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze
Insufferably bright.  O might I here
In solitude live savage, in some glad
Obscurd, where highest Woods impenetrable
To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,
And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
Hide me, where I may never see them more.
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
What best may for the present serve to hide
The Parts of each from other, that seem most
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,
And girded on our loyns, may cover round
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.

So counseld hee, and both together went
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renownd,
But such as at this day to _Indians_ known
In _Malabar_ or _Decan_ spreds her Armes
Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade
High overarcht, and echoing Walks between;
There oft the _Indian_ Herdsman shunning heate
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves
They gatherd, broad as _Amazonian_ Targe,
And with what skill they had, together sowd,
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike
To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late
_Columbus_ found th _American_ to girt
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.
Thus fenct, and as they thought, thir shame in part
Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,
They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares
Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within
Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,
Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore
Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once
And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:
For Understanding ruld not, and the Will
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now
To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe
Usurping over sovran Reason claimd
Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,
_Adam_, estrangd in look and alterd stile,
Speech intermitted thus to _Eve_ renewd.

Would thou hadst hearknd to my words, & staid
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild
Of all our good, shamd, naked, miserable.
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.

To whom soon movd with touch of blame thus _Eve_.
What words have past thy Lips, _Adam_ severe,
Imputst thou that to my default, or will
Of wandering, as thou callst it, which who knows
But might as ill have happnd thou being by,
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,
Or bere th attempt, thou couldst not have discernd
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
No ground of enmitie between us known,
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.
Was I to have never parted from thy side?
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head
Command me absolutely not to go,
Going into such danger as thou saidst?
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,
Neither had I transgressd, nor thou with mee.

To whom then first incenst _Adam_ replid.
Is this the Love, is the recompence
Of mine to thee, ingrateful _Eve_, exprest
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,
Who might have livd and joyd immortal bliss,
Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:
And am I now upbraided, as the cause
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?
I warnd thee, I admonishd thee, foretold
The danger, and the lurking Enemie
That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,
And force upon free Will hath here no place.
But confidence then bore thee on, secure
Either to meet no danger, or to finde
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps
I also errd in overmuch admiring
What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought
No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue
That errour now, which is become my crime,
And thou th accuser.  Thus it shall befall
Him who to worth in Women overtrusting
Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,
And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,
Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.

Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning
And of thir vain contest appeerd no end.

       THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST





  BOOK IX.

Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act
Of _Satan_ done in Paradise, and how
Hee in the Serpent had perverted _Eve_,
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,
Was known in Heavn; for what can scape the Eye
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,
Hinderd not _Satan_ to attempt the minde
Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will armd,
Complete to have discoverd and repulst
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.
For still they knew, and ought to have still rememberd
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
Incurrd, what could they less, the penaltie,
And manifold in sin, deservd to fall.
Up into Heavn from Paradise in hast
Th Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad
For Man, for of his state by this they knew,
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln
Entrance unseen.  Soon as th unwelcome news
From Earth arrivd at Heaven Gate, displeasd
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt
With pitie, violated not thir bliss.
About the new-arrivd, in multitudes
Th ethereal People ran, to hear and know
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream
Accountable made haste to make appear
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,
And easily approvd; when the most High
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,
Amidst in Thunder utterd thus his voice.

Assembld Angels, and ye Powers returnd
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,
Nor troubld at these tidings from the Earth,
Which your sincerest care could not prevent,
Foretold so lately what would come to pass,
When first this Tempter crossd the Gulf from Hell.
I told ye then he should prevail and speed
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduct
And flatterd out of all, believing lies
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine
Concurring to necessitate his Fall,
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
His free Will, to her own inclining left
In eevn scale.  But falln he is, and now
What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass
On his transgression, Death denounct that day,
Which he presumes already vain and void,
Because not yet inflicted, as he feard,
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.
Justice shall not return as bountie scornd.
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferrd
All Judgement, whether in Heavn, or Earth; or Hell.
Easie it may be seen that I intend
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his designd
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,
And destind Man himself to judge Man falln.

So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son
Blazd forth unclouded Deitie; he full
Resplendent all his Father manifest
Expressd, and thus divinely answerd milde.

Father Eternal, thine is to decree,
Mine both in Heavn and Earth to do thy will
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belovd
Mayst ever rest well pleasd.  I go to judge
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,
Whoever judgd, the worst on mee must light,
When time shall be, for so I undertook
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom
On me derivd, yet I shall temper so
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none
Are to behold the Judgement, but the judgd,
Those two; the third best absent is condemnd,
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.

Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence
_Eden_ and all the Coast in prospect lay.
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wingd.
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour
To fan the Earth now wakd, and usher in
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes
Brought to thir Ears, while day declind, they heard
And from his presence hid themselves among
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God
Approaching, thus to _Adam_ calld aloud.

Where art thou _Adam_, wont with joy to meet
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,
Not pleasd, thus entertaind with solitude,
Where obvious dutie erewhile appeard unsaught:
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change
Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.
He came, and with him _Eve_, more loth, though first
To offend, discountnanct both, and discomposd;
Love was not in thir looks, either to God
Or to each other, but apparent guilt,
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.
Whence _Adam_ faultring long, thus answerd brief.

I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice
Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom
The gracious Judge without revile replid.

My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feard,
But still rejoyct, how is it now become
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?

To whom thus _Adam_ sore beset replid.
O Heavn! in evil strait this day I stand
Before my Judge, either to undergoe
My self the total Crime, or to accuse
My other self, the partner of my life;
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,
I should conceal, and not expose to blame
By my complaint; but strict necessitie
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,
Least on my head both sin and punishment,
However insupportable, be all
Devolvd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.
This Woman whom thou madst to be my help,
And gavst me as thy perfet gift, so good,
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,
That from her hand I could suspect no ill,
And what she did, whatever in it self,
Her doing seemd to justifie the deed;
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.

To whom the sovran Presence thus replid.
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,
Superior, or but equal, that to her
Thou didst resigne thy Manhood, and the Place
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,
And for thee, whose perfection farr excelld
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd
She was indeed, and lovely to attract
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts
Were such as under Government well seemd,
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part
And person, hadst thou known thy self aright.

So having said, he thus to _Eve_ in few:
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?

To whom sad _Eve_ with shame nigh overwhelmd,
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht replid.

The Serpent me beguild and I did eate.

Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
To Judgement he proceeded on th accusd
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre
The Guilt on him who made him instrument
Of mischief, and polluted from the end
Of his Creation; justly then accurst,
As vitiated in Nature: more to know
Concernd not Man (since he no further knew)
Nor alterd his offence; yet God at last
To Satan first in sin his doom applyd,
Though in mysterious terms, judgd as then best:
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.

Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst
Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.
Between Thee and the Woman I will put
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;
Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.

So spake this Oracle, then verifid
When _Jesus_ son of _Mary_ second _Eve_,
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heavn,
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht
In open shew, and with ascention bright
Captivity led captive through the Aire,
The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turnd.

Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.

On _Adam_ last thus judgement he pronouncd.
Because thou hast hearknd to the voice of thy Wife,
And eaten of the Tree concerning which
I chargd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,
Cursd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;
Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th Herb of th Field,
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.

 So judgd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,
And th instant stroke of Death denounct that day
Removd farr off; then pittying how they stood
Before him naked to the aire, that now
Must suffer change, disdaind not to begin
Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,
As when he washd his servants feet, so now
As Father of his Familie he clad
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,
Araying coverd from his Fathers sight.
To him with swift ascent he up returnd,
Into his blissful bosom reassumd
In glory as of old, to him appeasd
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
Meanwhile ere thus was sind and judgd on Earth,
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,
In counterview within the Gates, that now
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
Farr into _Chaos_, since the Fiend passd through,
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.

O Son, why sit we here each other viewing
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides
For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be
But that success attends him; if mishap,
Ere this he had returnd, with fury drivn
By his Avenger, since no place like this
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
Wings growing, and Dominion givn me large
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,
Or sympathie, or som connatural force
Powerful at greatest distance to unite
With secret amity things of like kinde
By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade
Inseparable must with mee along:
For Death from Sin no power can separate.
But least the difficultie of passing back
Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe
Impassable, impervious, let us try
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine
Not unagreeable, to found a path
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument
Of merit high to all th infernal Host,
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,
Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
By this new felt attraction and instinct.

Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.
Goe whither Fate and inclination strong
Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
The savour of Death from all things there that live:
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.

So saying, with delight he snuffd the smell
Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,
Against the day of Battel, to a Field,
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lurd
With sent of living Carcasses designd
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.
So sented the grim Feature, and upturnd
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,
Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste
Wide Anarchie of _Chaos_ damp and dark
Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea
Tost up and down, together crowded drove
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse
Upon the _Cronian_ Sea, together drive
Mountains of Ice, that stop th imagind way
Beyond _Petsora_ Eastward, to the rich
_Cathaian_ Coast.  The aggregated Soyle
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,
As with a Trident smote, and fixt as firm
As _Delos_ floating once; the rest his look
Bound with _Gorgonian_ rigor not to move,
And with _Asphaltic_ slime; broad as the Gate,
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gatherd beach
They fastend, and the Mole immense wraught on
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall
Immoveable of this now fenceless world
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.
So, if great things to small may be compard,
_Xerxes_, the Libertie of _Greece_ to yoke,
From _Susa_ his _Memnonian_ Palace high
Came to the Sea, and over _Hellespont_
Bridging his way, _Europe_ with _Asia_ joynd,
And scourgd with many a stroak th indignant waves.
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock
Over the vext Abyss, following the track
Of _Satan_, to the selfsame place where hee
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe
From out of _Chaos_ to the outside bare
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made
And durable; and now in little space
The Confines met of Empyrean Heavn
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interposd; three sevral wayes
In sight, to each of these three places led.
And now thir way to Earth they had descrid,
To Paradise first tending, when behold
_Satan_ in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the _Centaure_ and the _Scorpion_ stearing
His _Zenith_, while the Sun in _Aries_ rose:
Disguisd he came, but those his Children dear
Thir Parent soon discernd, though in disguise.
Hee, after _Eve_ seduct, unminded slunk
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
By _Eve_, though all unweeting, seconded
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them, terrifid
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth
Might suddenly inflict; that past, returnd
By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood
Not instant, but of future time.  With joy
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returnd,
And at the brink of _Chaos_, neer the foot
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhopt
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreasd.
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.

O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,
Thy Trophies, which thou viewst as not thine own,
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:
For I no sooner in my Heart divind,
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie
Still moves with thine, joynd in connexion sweet,
That thou on Earth hadst prosperd, which thy looks
Now also evidence, but straight I felt
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt
That I must after thee with this thy Son;
Such fatal consequence unites us three:
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track.
Thou hast atchievd our libertie, confind
Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impowrd
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gaind
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully avengd
Our foile in Heavn; here thou shalt Monarch reign,
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,
As Battel hath adjudgd, from this new World
Retiring, by his own doom alienated,
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide
Of all things, parted by th Empyreal bounds,
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,
Or trie thee now more dangrous to his Throne.

Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,
High proof ye now have givn to be the Race
Of _Satan_ (for I glorie in the name,
Antagonist of Heavns Almightie King)
Amply have merited of me, of all
Th Infernal Empire, that so neer Heavns dore
Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm
Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent
Of easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
With these successes, and with them rejoyce,
You two this way, among those numerous Orbs
All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth
Dominion exercise and in the Aire,
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declard,
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might
Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,
Through Sin to Death exposd by my exploit.
If your joynt power prevaile, th affaires of Hell
No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.

So saying he dismissd them, they with speed
Thir course through thickest Constellations held
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips
Then sufferd.  Th other way _Satan_ went down
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side
Disparted _Chaos_ over built exclaimd,
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,
That scornd his indignation: through the Gate,
Wide open and unguarded, _Satan_ passd,
And all about found desolate; for those
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all
Farr to the inland retird, about the walls
Of _Pandemonium_, Citie and proud seate
Of _Lucifer_, so by allusion calld,
Of that bright Starr to _Satan_ paragond.
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance
Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee
Departing gave command, and they observd.
As when the _Tartar_ from his _Russian_ Foe
By _Astracan_ over the Snowie Plaines
Retires, or _Bactrian_ Sophi from the hornes
Of _Turkish_ Crescent, leaves all waste beyond
The Realme of _Aladule_, in his retreate
To _Tauris_ or _Casbeen_.  So these the late
Heavn-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell
Many a dark League, reduct in careful Watch
Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer from the search
Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,
In shew plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order, past; and from the dore
Of that _Plutonian_ Hall, invisible
Ascended his high Throne, which under state
Of richest texture spred, at th upper end
Was plact in regal lustre.  Down a while
He sate, and round about him saw unseen:
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head
And shape Starr bright appeerd, or brighter, clad
With what permissive glory since his fall
Was left him, or false glitter: All amazd
At that so sudden blaze the _Stygian_ throng
Bent thir aspect, and whom they wishd beheld,
Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th acclaime:
Forth rushd in haste the great consulting Peers,
Raisd from thir dark _Divan_, and with like joy
Congratulant approachd him, who with hand
Silence, and with these words attention won.

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,
For in possession such, not onely of right,
I call ye and declare ye now, returnd
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit
Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,
And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,
As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven
Little inferiour, by my adventure hard
With peril great atchievd.  Long were to tell
What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine
Voyagd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep
Of horrible confusion, over which
By Sin and Death a broad way now is pavd
To expedite your glorious march; but I
Toild out my uncouth passage, forct to ride
Th untractable Abysse, plungd in the womb
Of unoriginal _Night_ and _Chaos_ wilde,
That jealous of thir secrets fiercely opposd
My journey strange, with clamorous uproare
Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found
The new created World, which fame in Heavn
Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful
Of absolute perfection, therein Man
Plact in a Paradise, by our exile
Made happie: Him by fraud I have seducd
From his Creator, and the more to increase
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat
Offended, worth your laughter, hath givn up
Both his beloved Man and all his World,
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
Without our hazard, labour or allarme,
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
To rule, as over all he should have ruld.
True is, mee also he hath judgd, or rather
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape
Man I deceavd: that which to mee belongs,
Is enmity, which he will put between
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
A World who would not purchase with a bruise,
Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th account
Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,
But up and enter now into full bliss.

So having said, a while he stood, expecting
Thir universal shout and high applause
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears
On all sides, from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss, the sound
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining
Each other, till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power
Now ruld him, punisht in the shape he sind,
According to his doom: he would have spoke,
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue
To forked tongue, for now were all transformd
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now
With complicated monsters, head and taile,
Scorpion and Asp, and _Amphisbaena_ dire,
_Cerastes_ hornd, _Hydrus_, and _Ellops_ drear,
And _Dipsas_ (Not so thick swarmd once the Soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle
_Ophiusa_) but still greatest hee the midst,
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun
Ingenderd in the _Pythian_ Vale on slime,
Huge _Python_, and his Power no less he seemd
Above the rest still to retain; they all
Him followd issuing forth to th open Field,
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout
Heavn-falln, in station stood or just array,
Sublime with expectation when to see
In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,
And the dire hiss renewd, and the dire form
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,
As in thir crime.  Thus was th applause they meant,
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,
His will who reigns above, to aggravate
Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that
VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of _Eve_
Usd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
Thir earnest eyes they fixd, imagining
For one forbidden Tree a multitude
Now risn, to work them furder woe or shame;
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks
That curld _Megaera_: greedily they pluckd
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew
Neer that bituminous Lake where _Sodom_ flamd;
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
Deceavd; they fondly thinking to allay
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th offended taste
VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,
VVith hatefullest disrelish writhd thir jaws
VVith foot and cinders filld; so oft they fell
Into the same illusion, not as Man
Whom they triumphd once lapst.  Thus were they plagud
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resumd,
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo
This annual humbling certain numberd days,
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduct.
However some tradition they dispersd
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,
And Fabld how the Serpent, whom they calld
_Ophion_ with _Eurynome_, the wide-
Encroaching _Eve_ perhaps, had first the rule
Of high _Olympus_, thence by _Saturn_ drivn
And _Ops_, ere yet _Dictaean_ _Jove_ was born.
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrivd, _Sin_ there in power before,
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell
Habitual habitant; behind her _Death_
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
On his pale Horse: to whom _Sin_ thus began.

Second of _Satan_ sprung, all conquering Death,
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd
With travail difficult, not better farr
Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,
Unnamd, undreaded, and thy self half starvd?

Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,
There best, where most with ravin I may meet;
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.

To whom th incestuous Mother thus replid.
Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,
No homely morsels, and whatever thing
The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspard,
Till I in Man residing through the Race,
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,
And season him thy last and sweetest prey.

This said, they both betook them several wayes,
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
All kinds, and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later; which th Almightie seeing,
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,
To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.

See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I
So fair and good created, and had still
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man
Let in these wastful Furies, who impute
Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell
And his Adherents, that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavnly, and conniving seem
To gratifie my scornful Enemies,
That laugh, as if transported with some fit
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,
At random yeilded up to their misrule;
And know not that I calld and drew them thither
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure, till crammd and gorgd, nigh burst
With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,
Both _Sin_, and _Death_, and yawning _Grave_ at last
Through _Chaos_ hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.
Then Heavn and Earth renewd shall be made pure
To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:
Till then the Curse pronounct on both precedes.

Hee ended, and the heavnly Audience loud
Sung _Halleluia_, as the sound of Seas,
Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,
Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;
Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,
Destind restorer of Mankind, by whom
New Heavn and Earth shall to the Ages rise,
Or down from Heavn descend.  Such was thir song,
While the Creator calling forth by name
His mightie Angels gave them several charge,
As sorted best with present things.  The Sun
Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring
Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone
Her office they prescribd, to th other five
Thir planetarie motions and aspects
In _Sextile_, _Square_, and _Trine_, and _Opposite_,
Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne
In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt
Thir influence malignant when to showre,
Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,
Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set
Thir corners, when with bluster to confound
Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle
With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.
Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse
The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
From the Suns Axle; they with labour pushd
Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun
Was bid turn Reines from th Equinoctial Rode
Like distant breadth to _Taurus_ with the Seavn
_Atlantick_ Sisters, and the _Spartan_ Twins
Up to the _Tropic_ Crab; thence down amaine
By _Leo_ and the _Virgin_ and the _Scales_,
As deep as _Capricorne_, to bring in change
Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring
Perpetual smild on Earth with vernant Flours,
Equal in Days and Nights, except to those
Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun
To recompence his distance, in thir sight
Had rounded still th _Horizon_, and not known
Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow
From cold _Estotiland_, and South as farr
Beneath _Magellan_.  At that tasted Fruit
The Sun, as from _Thyestean_ Banquet, turnd
His course intended; else how had the World
Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?
These changes in the Heavns, though slow, producd
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North
Of _Norumbega_, and the _Samoed_ shoar
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,
_Boreas_ and _Caecias_ and _Argestes_ loud
And _Thrascias_ rend the Woods and Seas upturn;
With adverse blast up-turns them from the South
_Notus_ and _Afer_ black with thundrous Clouds
From _Serraliona_; thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the _Levant_ and the _Ponent_ VVindes
_Eurus_ and _Zephir_ with thir lateral noise,
_Sirocco_, and _Libecchio_. Thus began
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first
Daughter of Sin, among th irrational,
Death introducd through fierce antipathie:
Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe
Of Man, but fled him, or with countnance grim
Glard on him passing: these were from without
The growing miseries, which _Adam_ saw
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,
And in a troubld Sea of passion tost,
Thus to disburdn sought with sad complaint.

O miserable of happie! is this the end
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end
The miserie, I deservd it, and would beare
My own deservings; but this will not serve;
All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,
Is propagated curse.  O voice once heard
Delightfully, _Encrease and Multiply_,
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease
Or multiplie, but curses on my head?
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling
The evil on him brought by me, will curse
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,
For this we may thank _Adam_; but his thanks
Shall be the execration; so besides
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,
On mee as on thir natural center light
Heavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes
Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!
Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay
To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee
From darkness to promote me, or here place
In this delicious Garden? as my Will
Concurd not to my being, it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust,
Desirous to resigne, and render back
All I receavd, unable to performe
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold
The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable
Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,
I thus contest; then should have been refusd
Those terms whatever, when they were proposd:
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,
Then cavil the conditions? and though God
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son
Prove disobedient, and reprovd, retort,
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,
But Natural necessity begot.
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes
His hand to execute what his Decree
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,
Why am I mockt with death, and lengthnd out
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth
Insensible, how glad would lay me down
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me
With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man
Which God inspird, cannot together perish
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,
Or in some other dismal place, who knows
But I shall die a living Death?  O thought
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath
Of Life that sinnd; what dies but what had life
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.
All of me then shall die: let this appease
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.
For though the Lord of all be infinite,
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,
But mortal doomd.  How can he exercise
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make
Strange contradiction, which to God himself
Impossible is held, as Argument
Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,
For angers sake, finite to infinite
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour
Satisfid never; that were to extend
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,
By which all Causes else according still
To the reception of thir matter act,
Not to th extent of thir own Spheare.  But say
That Death be not one stroak, as I supposd,
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie
From this day onward, which I feel begun
Both in me, and without me, and so last
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
On my defensless head; both Death and I
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,
Nor I on my part single, in mee all
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!
So disinherited how would ye bless
Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemnd,
If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will depravd,
Not to do onely, but to will the same
With me? how can they acquitted stand
In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes
Forct I absolve: all my evasions vain
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still
But to my own conviction: first and last
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;
So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,
Then all the world much heavier, though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desirst,
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future,
To _Satan_ onely like both crime and doom.
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears
And horrors hast thou drivn me; out of which
I find no way, from deep to deeper plungd!

Thus _Adam_ to himself lamented loud
Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,
Which to his evil Conscience represented
All things with double terror: On the ground
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft
Cursd his Creation, Death as oft accusd
Of tardie execution, since denounct
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
Justice Divine not hastn to be just?
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,
VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades
To answer, and resound farr other Song.
VVhom thus afflicted when sad _Eve_ beheld,
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayd:
But her with stern regard he thus repelld.

Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best
Befits thee with him leagud, thy self as false
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee
Henceforth; least that too heavnly form, pretended
To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,
Rejected my forewarning, and disdaind
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting
Foold and beguild, by him thou, I by thee,
To trust thee from my side, imagind wise,
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,
And understood not all was but a shew
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
More to the part sinister from me drawn,
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie
To my just number found.  O why did God,
Creator wise, that peopld highest Heavn
With Spirits Masculine, create at last
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once
With Men as Angels without Feminine,
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind? this mischief had not then befalln,
And more that shall befall, innumerable
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:
Which infinite calamitie shall cause
To humane life, and houshold peace confound.

He added not, and from her turnd, but _Eve_
Not so repulst, with Tears that ceasd not flowing,
And tresses all disorderd, at his feet
Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.

Forsake me not thus, _Adam_, witness Heavn
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,
Unhappilie deceavd; thy suppliant
I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,
My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,
Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,
As joynd in injuries, one enmitie
Against a Foe by doom express assignd us,
That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not
Thy hatred for this miserie befalln,
On me already lost, mee then thy self
More miserable; both have sind, but thou
Against God onely, I against God and thee,
And to the place of judgement will return,
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all
The sentence from thy head removd may light
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,
Mee mee onely just object of his ire.

She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,
Immoveable till peace obtaind from fault
Acknowledgd and deplord, in _Adam_ wraught
Commiseration; soon his heart relented
Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,
Now at his feet submissive in distress,
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,
His counsel whom she had displeasd, his aide;
As one disarmd, his anger all he lost,
And thus with peaceful words upraisd her soon.

Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,
So now of what thou knowst not, who desirst
The punishment all on thy self; alas,
Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine
His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,
And my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,
That on my head all might be visited,
Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgivn,
To me committed and by me exposd.
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame
Each other, blamd enough elsewhere, but strive
In offices of Love, how we may lightn
Each others burden in our share of woe;
Since this days Death denounct, if ought I see,
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pact evill,
A long days dying to augment our paine,
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) derivd.

To whom thus _Eve_, recovering heart, replid.
_Adam_, by sad experiment I know
How little weight my words with thee can finde,
Found so erroneous, thence by just event
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,
Restord by thee, vile as I am, to place
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,
Living or dying from thee I will not hide
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are risn,
Tending to som relief of our extremes,
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,
As in our evils, and of easier choice.
If care of our descent perplex us most,
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd
By Death at last, and miserable it is
To be to others cause of misery,
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring
Into this cursed World a woful Race,
That after wretched Life must be at last
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
Childless thou art, Childless remaine:
So Death shall be deceavd his glut, and with us two
Be forcd to satisfie his Ravnous Maw.
But if thou judge it hard and difficult,
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,
And with desire to languish without hope,
Before the present object languishing
With like desire, which would be miserie
And torment less then none of what we dread,
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free
From what we fear for both, let us make short,
Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply
With our own hands his Office on our selves;
Why stand we longer shivering under feares,
That shew no end but Death, and have the power,
Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,
Destruction with destruction to destroy.

She ended heer, or vehement despaire
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts
Had entertaind, as did her Cheeks with pale.
But _Adam_ with such counsel nothing swayd,
To better hopes his more attentive minde
Labouring had raisd, and thus to _Eve_ replid.

_Eve_, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
To argue in thee somthing more sublime
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes
That excellence thought in thee, and implies,
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret
For loss of life and pleasure overlovd.
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end
Of miserie, so thinking to evade
The penaltie pronounct, doubt not but God
Hath wiselier armd his vengeful ire then so
To be forestalld; much more I fear least Death
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts
Of contumacie will provoke the highest
To make death in us live: Then let us seek
Som safer resolution, which methinks
I have in view, calling to minde with heed
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe
_Satan_, who in the Serpent hath contrivd
Against us this deceit: to crush his head
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost
By death brought on our selves, or childless days
Resolvd, as thou proposest; so our Foe
Shall scape his punishment ordaind, and wee
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
No more be mentiond then of violence
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,
Reluctance against God and his just yoke
Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild
And gracious temper he both heard and judgd
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected
Immediate dissolution, which we thought
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,
And bringing forth, soon recompenct with joy,
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope
Glancd on the ground, with labour I must earne
My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands
Cloathd us unworthie, pitying while he judgd;
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,
And teach us further by what means to shun
Th inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,
Which now the Skie with various Face begins
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish
Our Limbs benummd, ere this diurnal Starr
Leave cold the Night, how we his gatherd beams
Reflected, may with matter sere foment,
Or by collision of two bodies grinde
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame drivn down
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,
And sends a comfortable heat from farr,
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,
And what may else be remedie or cure
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear
To pass commodiously this life, sustaind
By him with many comforts, till we end
In dust, our final rest and native home.
What better can we do, then to the place
Repairing where he judgd us, prostrate fall
Before him reverent, and there confess
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears
VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeignd, and humiliation meek.
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn
From his displeasure; in whose look serene,
VVhen angry most he seemd and most severe,
VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?

So spake our Father penitent, nor _Eve_
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place
Repairing where he judgd them prostrate fell
Before him reverent, and both confessd
Humbly thir faults, and pardon begd, with tears
VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeignd, and humiliation meek.

       THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK.

  PARADISE LOST.





  BOOK X.

Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
Prevenient Grace descending had removd
The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh
Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breathd
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
Inspird, and wingd for Heavn with speedier flight
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port
Not of mean suiters, nor important less
Seemd thir Petition, then when th ancient Pair
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
_Deucalion_ and chaste _Pyrrha_ to restore
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine
Of _Themis_ stood devout.  To Heavn thir prayers
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passd
Dimentionless through Heavnly dores; then clad
With incense, where the Golden Altar fumd,
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
Presenting, thus to intercede began.

See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
Sown with contrition in his heart, then those
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees
Of Paradise could have product, ere falln
From innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;
Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate
And propitiation, all his works on mee
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.
Accept me, and in mee from these receave
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live
Before thee reconcild, at least his days
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,
Made one with me as I with thee am one.

To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:
But longer in that Paradise to dwell,
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:
Those pure immortal Elements that know
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,
And mortal food, as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt
Corrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts
Created him endowd, with Happiness
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,
This other servd but to eternize woe;
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes
His final remedie, and after Life
Trid in sharp tribulation, and refind
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,
Wakt in the renovation of the just,
Resignes him up with Heavn and Earth renewd.
But let us call to Synod all the Blest
Through Heavns wide bounds; from them I will not hide
My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,
As how with peccant Angels late they saw;
And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.

He ended, and the Son gave signal high
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew
His Trumpet, heard in _Oreb_ since perhaps
When God descended, and perhaps once more
To sound at general Doom.  Th Angelic blast
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs
Of _Amarantin_ Shade, Fountain or Spring,
By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream
Th Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.

O Sons, like one of us Man is become
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,
Happier, had it sufficd him to have known
Good by it self, and Evil not at all.
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,
My motions in him, longer then they move,
His heart I know, how variable and vain
Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
And live for ever, dream at least to live
Forever, to remove him I decree,
And send him from the Garden forth to Till
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.

_Michael_, this my behest have thou in charge,
Take to thee from among the Cherubim
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
Vacant possession som new trouble raise:
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,
From hallowd ground th unholie, and denounce
To them and to thir Progenie from thence
Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint
At the sad Sentence rigorously urgd,
For I behold them softnd and with tears
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.
If patiently thy bidding they obey,
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale
To _Adam_ what shall come in future dayes,
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix
My Covnant in the Womans seed renewd;
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
And on the East side of the Garden place,
Where entrance up from _Eden_ easiest climbes,
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:
Least Paradise a receptacle prove
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,
With whose stoln Fruit Man once more to delude.

He ceasd; and th Archangelic Power prepard
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
Had, like a double _Janus_, all thir shape
Spangld with eyes more numerous then those
Of _Argus_, and more wakeful then to drouze,
Charmd with _Arcadian_ Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
Of _Hermes_, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile
To resalute the World with sacred Light
_Leucothea_ wakd, and with fresh dews imbalmd
The Earth, when _Adam_ and first Matron _Eve_
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,
Strength added from above, new hope to spring
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;
Which thus to _Eve_ his welcome words renewd.

_Eve_, easily may Faith admit, that all
The good which we enjoy, from Heavn descends
But that from us ought should ascend to Heavn
So prevalent as to concerne the mind
Of God high blest, or to incline his will,
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne
Evn to the Seat of God.  For since I saught
By Prayer th offended Deitie to appease,
Kneeld and before him humbld all my heart,
Methought I saw him placable and mild,
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd
Home to my brest, and to my memorie
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now
Assures me that the bitterness of death
Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,
_Eve_ rightly calld, Mother of all Mankind,
Mother of all things living, since by thee
Man is to live, and all things live for Man.

To whom thus _Eve_ with sad demeanour meek.
Ill worthie I such title should belong
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
That I who first brought Death on all, am gract
The sourse of life; next favourable thou,
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaft,
Farr other name deserving.  But the Field
To labour calls us now with sweat imposd,
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,
All unconcernd with our unrest, begins
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,
I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?
Here let us live, though in falln state, content.

So spake, so wishd much-humbld _Eve_, but Fate
Subscribd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclipsd
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
The Bird of _Jove_, stoopt from his aerie tour,
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
First Hunter then, pursud a gentle brace,
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;
Direct to th Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.
_Adam_ observd, and with his Eye the chase
Pursuing, not unmovd to _Eve_ thus spake.

O _Eve_, some furder change awaits us nigh,
Which Heavn by these mute signs in Nature shews
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn
Us haply too secure of our discharge
From penaltie, because from death releast
Some days; how long, and what till then our life,
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,
And thither must return and be no more.
VVhy else this double object in our sight
Of flight pursud in th Air and ore the ground
One way the self-same hour? why in the East
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light
More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws
Ore the blew Firmament a radiant white,
And slow descends, with somthing heavnly fraught.

He errd not, for by this the heavnly Bands
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
And carnal fear that day dimmd _Adams_ eye.
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
_Jacob_ in _Mahanaim_, where he saw
The field Paviliond with his Guardians bright;
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd
In _Dothan_, coverd with a Camp of Fire,
Against the _Syrian_ King, who to surprize
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,
Warr unproclamd.  The Princely Hierarch
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise
Possession of the Garden; hee alone,
To finde where _Adam_ shelterd, took his way,
Not unperceavd of _Adam_, who to _Eve_,
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.

_Eve_, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
Of us will soon determin, or impose
New Laws to be observd; for I descrie
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill
One of the heavnly Host, and by his Gate
None of the meanest, some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,
As _Raphael_, that I should much confide,
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
He ended; and th Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes
A militarie Vest of purple flowd
Livelier then _Meliboean_, or the graine
Of _Sarra_, worn by Kings and Heros old
In time of Truce; _Iris_ had dipt the wooff;
His starrie Helme unbuckld shewd him prime
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side
As in a glistering _Zodiac_ hung the Sword,
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.
_Adam_ bowd low, hee Kingly from his State
Inclind not, but his coming thus declard.

_Adam_, Heavns high behest no Preface needs:
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
Defeated of his seisure many dayes
Givn thee of Grace, wherein thou mayst repent,
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeasd
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;
But longer in this Paradise to dwell
Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
And send thee from the Garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast takn, fitter Soile.

He added not, for _Adam_ at the newes
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
That all his senses bound; _Eve_, who unseen
Yet all had heard, with audible lament
Discoverd soon the place of her retire.

O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day
That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,
That never will in other Climate grow,
My early visitation, and my last
At Eevn, which I bred up with tender hand
From the first opning bud, and gave ye Names,
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke
Your Tribes, and water from th ambrosial Fount?
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee
How shall I part, and whither wander down
Into a lower World, to this obscure
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?

Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.
Lament not _Eve_, but patiently resigne
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,
Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
Where he abides, think there thy native soile.

_Adam_ by this from the cold sudden damp
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,
To _Michael_ thus his humble words addressd.

Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or namd
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
And in performing end us; what besides
Of sorrow and dejection and despair
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,
Departure from this happy place, our sweet
Recess, and onely consolation left
Familiar to our eyes, all places else
Inhospitable appeer and desolate,
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of him who all things can, I would not cease
To wearie him with my assiduous cries:
But prayer against his absolute Decree
No more availes then breath against the winde,
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
This most afflicts me, that departing hence,
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd
His blessed countnance; here I could frequent,
With worship, place by place where he voutsafd
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talkd:
So many grateful Altars I would reare
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,
Or monument to Ages, and thereon
Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:
In yonder nether World where shall I seek
His bright appearances, or footstep trace?
For though I fled him angrie, yet recalld
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.

To whom thus _Michael_ with regard benigne.
_Adam_, thou knowst Heavn his, and all the Earth
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
All th Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
No despicable gift; surmise not then
His presence to these narrow bounds confind
Of Paradise or _Eden_: this had been
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred
All generations, and had hither come
From all the ends of th Earth, to celebrate
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine
God is as here, and will be found alike
Present, and of his presence many a signe
Still following thee, still compassing thee round
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
True patience, and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow, equally enurd
By moderation either state to beare,
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life, and best prepard endure
Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend
This Hill; let _Eve_ (for I have drencht her eyes)
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakst,
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.

To whom thus _Adam_ gratefully replid.
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
Thou leadst me, and to the hand of Heavn submit,
However chastning, to the evil turne
My obvious breast, arming to overcom
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,
If so I may attain.  So both ascend
In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken
Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
Our second _Adam_ in the Wilderness,
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.
His Eye might there command wherever stood
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls
Of _Cambalu_, seat of _Cathaian Can_
And _Samarchand_ by _Oxus_, _Temirs_ Throne,
To _Paquin_ of _Sinaean_ Kings, and thence
To _Agra_ and _Lahor_ of great _Mogul_
Down to the golden _Chersones_, or where
The _Persian_ in _Ecbatan_ sate, or since
In _Hispahan_, or where the _Russian Ksar_
In _Mosco_, or the Sultan in _Bizance_,
_Turchestan_-born; nor could his eye not ken
Th Empire of _Negus_ to his utmost Port
_Ercoco_ and the less Maritine Kings
_Mombaza_, and _Quiloa_, and _Melind_,
And _Sofala_ thought _Ophir_, to the Realme
Of _Congo_, and _Angola_ fardest South;
Or thence from _Niger_ Flood to _Atlas_ Mount
The Kingdoms of _Almansor_, _Fez_, and _Sus_,
_Marocco_ and _Algiers_, and _Tremisen_;
On _Europe_ thence, and where _Rome_ was to sway
The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
Rich _Mexico_ the seat of _Motezume_,
And _Cusco_ in _Peru_, the richer seat
Of _Atabalipa_, and yet unspoild
_Guiana_, whose great Citie _Geryons_ Sons
Call _El Dorado:_ but to nobler sights
_Michael_ from _Adams_ eyes the Filme removd
VVhich that false Fruit that promisd clearer sight
Had bred; then purgd with Euphrasie and Rue
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
And from the VVell of Life three drops instilld.
So deep the power of these Ingredients piercd,
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,
That _Adam_ now enforct to close his eyes,
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon raisd, and his attention thus recalld.

_Adam_, now ope thine eyes, and first behold
Th effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee, who never touchd
Th excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspird,
Nor sinnd thy sin, yet from that sin derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.

His eyes he opnd, and beheld a field,
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;
Ith midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,
Unculld, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strewd,
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites performd.
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heavn
Consumd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;
The others not, for his was not sincere;
Whereat hee inlie ragd, and as they talkd,
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effusd.
Much at that sight was _Adam_ in his heart
Dismaid, and thus in haste to th Angel crid.

O Teacher, some great mischief hath befalln
To that meek man, who well had sacrificd;
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?

T whom _Michael_ thus, hee also movd, replid.
These two are Brethren, _Adam_, and to come
Out of thy loyns; th unjust the just hath slain,
For envie that his Brothers Offering found
From Heavn acceptance; but the bloodie Fact
Will be avengd, and th others Faith approvd
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
Rowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire.

Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way
I must return to native dust?  O sight
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!

To whom thus _Michael_.  Death thou hast seen
In his first shape on man; but many shapes
Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
More terrible at th entrance then within.
Some, as thou sawst, by violent stroke shall die,
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more
In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know
What miserie th inabstinence of _Eve_
Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid
Numbers of all diseasd, all maladies
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,
Dropsies, and Asthmas, and Joint-racking Rheums.
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;
And over them triumphant Death his Dart
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invokt
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
Drie-eyd behold?  _Adam_ could not, but wept,
Though not of Woman born; compassion quelld
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,
And scarce recovering words his plaint renewd.

O miserable Mankind, to what fall
Degraded, to what wretched state reservd?
Better end heer unborn.  Why is life givn
To be thus wrested from us? rather why
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
What we receive, would either not accept
Life offerd, or soon beg to lay it down,
Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus
Th Image of God in man created once
So goodly and erect, though faultie since,
To such unsightly sufferings be debast
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,
Retaining still Divine similitude
In part, from such deformities be free,
And for his Makers Image sake exempt?

Thir Makers Image, answerd _Michael_, then
Forsook them, when themselves they villifid
To serve ungovernd appetite, and took
His Image whom they servd, a brutish vice,
Inductive mainly to the sin of _Eve_.
Therefore so abject is thir punishment,
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,
Or if his likeness, by themselves defact
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.

I yeild it just, said _Adam_, and submit.
But is there yet no other way, besides
These painful passages, how we may come
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?

There is, said _Michael_, if thou well observe
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
Till many years over thy head return:
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:
This is old age; but then thou must outlive
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne
A melancholly damp of cold and dry
To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume
The Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.

Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong
Life much, bent rather how I may be quit
Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,
Which I must keep till my appointed day
Of rendring up.  _Michael_ to him replid.

Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst
Live well, how long or short permit to Heavn:
And now prepare thee for another sight.

He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound
Of Instruments that made melodious chime
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
Instinct through all proportions low and high
Fled and pursud transverse the resonant fugue.
In other part stood one who at the Forge
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass
Had melted (whether found where casual fire
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
Into fit moulds prepard; from which he formd
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought
Fulfil or gravn in mettle.  After these,
But on the hether side a different sort
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent
To worship God aright, and know his works
Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
The Men though grave, eyd them, and let thir eyes
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
Fast caught, they likd, and each his liking chose;
And now of love they treat till th Eevning Star
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invokt;
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.
Such happy interview and fair event
Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
And charming Symphonies attachd the heart
Of _Adam_, soon enclind to admit delight,
The bent of Nature; which he thus expressd.

True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.

To whom thus _Michael_.  Judg not what is best
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
Created, as thou art, to nobler end
Holie and pure, conformitie divine.
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
Who slew his Brother; studious they appere
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledgd none.
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
Yet empty of all good wherein consists
Womans domestic honour and chief praise;
Bred onely and completed to the taste
Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
Religious titld them the Sons of God,
Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame
Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.

To whom thus _Adam_ of short joy bereft.
O pittie and shame, that they who to live well
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
But still I see the tenor of Mans woe
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.

From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
Said th Angel, who should better hold his place
By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.
But now prepare thee for another Scene.

He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
Single or in Array of Battel rangd
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;
One way a Band select from forage drives
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,
But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;
Where Cattel pasturd late, now scatterd lies
With Carcasses and Arms th ensanguind Field
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong
Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,
Assaulting; others from the Wall defend
With Dart and Javlin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
In other part the scepterd Haralds call
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
In factious opposition, till at last
Of middle Age one rising, eminent
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
And Judgement from above: him old and young
Exploded, and had seizd with violent hands,
Had not a Cloud descending snatchd him thence
Unseen amid the throng: so violence
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
_Adam_ was all in tears, and to his guide
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
Inhumanly to men, and multiply
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
His Brother; for of whom such massacher
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heavn
Rescud, had in his Righteousness bin lost?

To whom thus _Michael_; These are the product
Of those ill-mated Marriages thou sawst;
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admird,
And Valour and Heroic Vertu calld;
To overcome in Battel, and subdue
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done
Of triumph, to be styld great Conquerours,
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
Destroyers rightlier calld and Plagues of men.
Thus Fame shall be achievd, renown on Earth,
And what most merits fame in silence hid.
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
The onely righteous in a World perverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so beset
With Foes for daring single to be just,
And utter odious Truth, that God would come
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.

He lookd, & saw the face of things quite changd;
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
All now was turnd to jollitie and game,
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.
At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
And of thir doings great dislike declard,
And testifid against thir wayes; hee oft
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
In prison under Judgements imminent:
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceasd
Contending, and removd his Tents farr off;
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
Measurd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
Contrivd, and of provisions laid in large
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!
Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons
With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
From under Heavn; the Hills to their supplie
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
Sent up amain; and now the thicknd Skie
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rushd the Rain
Impetuous, and continud till the Earth
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting ore the Waves, all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
Deep under water rould; Sea coverd Sea,
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
Where luxurie late reignd, Sea-monsters whelpd
And stabld; of Mankind, so numerous late,
All left, in one small bottom swum imbarkt.
How didst thou grieve then, _Adam_, to behold
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
Depopulation; thee another Floud,
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drownd,
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
By th Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;
And scarce to th Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.

O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
Livd ignorant of future, so had borne
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot
Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst
The burdn of many Ages, on me light
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
And hee the future evil shall no less
In apprehension then in substance feel
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
Man is not whom to warne: those few escapt
Famin and anguish will at last consume
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope
When violence was ceast, and Warr on Earth,
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd
With length of happy days the race of man;
But I was farr deceavd; for now I see
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,
And whether here the Race of man will end.
To whom thus _Michael_.  Those whom last thou sawst
In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
First seen in acts of prowess eminent
And great exploits, but of true vertu void;
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.
The conquerd also, and enslavd by Warr
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feignd
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th Earth shall bear
More then anough, that temperance may be trid:
So all shall turn degenerate, all depravd,
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
One Man except, the onely Son of light
In a dark Age, against example good,
Against allurement, custom, and a World
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes
Shall them admonish, and before them set
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come
On thir impenitence; and shall returne
Of them derided, but of God observd
The one just Man alive; by his command
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,
To save himself and houshold from amidst
A World devote to universal rack.
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodgd,
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts
Of Heavn set open on the Earth shall powre
Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,
With all his verdure spoild, and Trees adrift
Down the great River to the opning Gulf,
And there take root an Iland salt and bare,
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
To teach thee that God attributes to place
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
And now what further shall ensue, behold.

He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie
Wrinkld the face of Deluge, as decaid;
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass
Gazd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt
His Sluces, as the Heavn his windows shut.
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,
And after him, the surer messenger,
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
The second time returning, in his Bill
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
Grateful to Heavn, over his head beholds
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,
Betokning peace from God, and Covnant new.
Whereat the heart of _Adam_ erst so sad
Greatly rejoycd, and thus his joy broke forth.

O thou that future things canst represent
As present, Heavnly instructer, I revive
At this last sight, assurd that Man shall live
With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.
Farr less I now lament for one whole World
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce
For one Man found so perfet and so just,
That God voutsafes to raise another World
From him, and all his anger to forget.
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,
Distended as the Brow of God appeasd,
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,
Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?

To whom th Archangel.  Dextrously thou aimst;
So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
Though late repenting him of Man depravd,
Grievd at his heart, when looking down he saw
The whole Earth filld with violence, and all flesh
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoovd,
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
And makes a Covenant never to destroy
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
His triple-colourd Bow, whereon to look
And call to mind his Covnant: Day and Night,
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,
Both Heavn and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;
And Man as from a second stock proceed.
Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:
Henceforth what is to com I will relate,
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
This second sours of Men, while yet but few,
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,
With large Wine-offerings pourd, and sacred Feast
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblamd, and dwell
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart, who not content
With fair equalitie, fraternal state,
Will arrogate Dominion undeservd
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;
Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)
With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse
Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:
A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styld
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heavn,
Or from Heavn claming second Sovrantie;
And from Rebellion shall derive his name,
Though of Rebellion others he accuse.
Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns
With him or under him to tyrannize,
Marching from _Eden_ towards the West, shall finde
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build
A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heavn;
And get themselves a name, least far disperst
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,
Regardless whether good or evil fame.
But God who oft descends to visit men
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower
Obstruct Heavn Towrs, and in derision sets
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
Among the Builders; each to other calls
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,
As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heavn
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange
And hear the din; thus was the building left
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion namd.

Whereto thus _Adam_ fatherly displeasd.
O execrable Son so to aspire
Above his Brethren, to himself affirming
Authoritie usurpt, from God not givn:
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl
Dominion absolute; that right we hold
By his donation; but Man over men
He made not Lord; such title to himself
Reserving, human left from human free.
But this Usurper his encroachment proud
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food
Will he convey up thither to sustain
Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire
Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,
And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?

To whom thus _Michael_.  Justly thou abhorrst
That Son, who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
Rational Libertie; yet know withall,
Since thy original lapse, true Libertie
Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells
Twinnd, and from her hath no dividual being:
Reason in man obscurd, or not obeyd,
Immediately inordinate desires
And upstart Passions catch the Government
From Reason, and to servitude reduce
Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits
Within himself unworthie Powers to reign
Over free Reason, God in Judgement just
Subjects him from without to violent Lords;
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext
Deprives them of thir outward libertie,
Thir inward lost: Witness th irreverent Son
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,
_Servant of Servants_, on his vitious Race.
Thus will this latter, as the former World,
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
His presence from among them, and avert
His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;
And one peculiar Nation to select
From all the rest, of whom to be invokd,
A Nation from one faithful man to spring:
Him on this side _Euphrates_ yet residing,
Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
While yet the Patriark livd, who scapd the Flood,
As to forsake the living God, and fall
To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone
For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes
To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise
A mightie Nation, and upon him showre
His benediction so, that in his Seed
All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile
_Ur_ of _Chaldaea_, passing now the Ford
To _Haran_, after him a cumbrous Train
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth
With God, who calld him, in a land unknown.
_Canaan_ he now attains, I see his Tents
Pitcht about _Sechem_, and the neighbouring Plaine
Of _Moreb_ there by promise he receaves
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;
From _Hamath_ Northward to the Desert South
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnamd)
From _Hermon_ East to the great Western Sea,
Mount _Hermon_, yonder Sea, each place behold
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare
Mount _Carmel_; here the double-founted stream
_Jordan_, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
Shall dwell to _Senir_, that long ridge of Hills.
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,
Whom _Faithful Abraham_ due time shall call,
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs
From _Canaan_, to a Land hereafter calld
_Egypt_, divided by the River _Nile_;
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
He comes invited by a yonger Son
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that Realme
Of _Pharao_: there he dies, and leaves his Race
Growing into a Nation, and now grown
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call
_Moses_ and _Aaron_) sent from God to claime
His people from enthralment, they return
With glory and spoile back to thir promisd Land.
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
To know thir God, or message to regard,
Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
With loathd intrusion, and fill all the land;
His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,
Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,
And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,
Haile mixt with fire must rend th _Egyptian_ Skie
And wheel on th Earth, devouring where it rouls;
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,
A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
Of _Egypt_ must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds
This River-dragon tamd at length submits
To let his sojourners depart, and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice
More hardnd after thaw, till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass
As on drie land between two christal walls,
Awd by the rod of _Moses_ so to stand
Divided, till his rescud gain thir shoar:
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,
To guide them in thir journey, and remove
Behinde them, while th obdurat King pursues:
All night he will pursue, but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning Watch;
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud
God looking forth will trouble all his Host
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command
_Moses_ once more his potent Rod extends
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;
On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,
And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect
Safe towards _Canaan_ from the shoar advance
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,
Least entring on the _Canaanite_ allarmd
Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare
Return them back to _Egypt_, choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude; for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.
This also shall they gain by thir delay
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found
Thir government, and thir great Senate choose
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:
God from the Mount of _Sinai_, whose gray top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine
To civil Justice, part religious Rites
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech
That _Moses_ might report to them his will,
And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high Office now
_Moses_ in figure beares, to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times
Of great _Messiah_ shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites
Establisht, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes
Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescript a Sanctuary is framd
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
The Records of his Covnant, over these
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
The Heavnly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,
Save when they journie, and at length they come,
Conducted by his Angel to the Land
Promisd to _Abraham_ and his Seed: the rest
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,
How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heavn stand still
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,
Mans voice commanding, Sun in _Gibeon_ stand,
And thou Moon in the vale of _Aialon_,
Till _Israel_ overcome; so call the third
From _Abraham_, Son of _Isaac_, and from him
His whole descent, who thus shall _Canaan_ win.

Here _Adam_ interposd.  O sent from Heavn,
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne
Just _Abraham_ and his Seed: now first I finde
Mine eyes true opning, and my heart much easd,
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbiddn knowledge by forbiddn means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth
So many and so various Laws are givn;
So many Laws argue so many sins
Among them; how can God with such reside?

To whom thus _Michael_.  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
And therefore was Law given them to evince
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
Law can discover sin, but not remove,
Save by those shadowie expiations weak,
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde
Justification towards God, and peace
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
Perform, and not performing cannot live.
So Law appears imperfet, and but givn
With purpose to resign them in full time
Up to a better Covnant, disciplind
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
From imposition of strict Laws, to free
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
And therefore shall not _Moses_, though of God
Highly belovd, being but the Minister
Of Law, his people into _Canaan_ lead;
But _Joshua_ whom the Gentiles _Jesus_ call,
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
Meanwhile they in thir earthly _Canaan_ plact
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
National interrupt thir public peace,
Provoking God to raise them enemies:
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
The second, both for pietie renownd
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock
Of _David_ (so I name this King) shall rise
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,
Foretold to _Abraham_, as in whom shall trust
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.
But first a long succession must ensue,
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom famd,
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.
Such follow him, as shall be registerd
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou sawst
Left in confusion, _Babylon_ thence calld.
There in captivitie he lets them dwell
The space of seventie years, then brings them back,
Remembring mercie, and his Covnant sworn
To _David_, stablisht as the dayes of Heavn.
Returnd from _Babylon_ by leave of Kings
Thir Lords, whom God disposd, the house of God
They first re-edifie, and for a while
In mean estate live moderate, till grown
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
But first among the Priests dissension springs,
Men who attend the Altar, and should most
Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings
Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise
The Scepter, and regard not _Davids_ Sons,
Then loose it to a stranger, that the true
Anointed King _Messiah_ might be born
Barrd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr
Unseen before in Heavn proclaims him com,
And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire
His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;
They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire
Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.
A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire
The Power of the most High; he shall ascend
The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign
With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heavns.

He ceasd, discerning _Adam_ with such joy
Surchargd, as had like grief bin dewd in tears,
Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.

O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand
What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,
Why our great expectation should be calld
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,
High in the love of Heavn, yet from my Loynes
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son
Of God most High; So God with man unites.
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.

To whom thus _Michael_.  Dream not of thir fight,
As of a Duel, or the local wounds
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome
_Satan_, whose fall from Heavn, a deadlier bruise,
Disabld not to give thee thy deaths wound:
Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
Not by destroying _Satan_, but his works
In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,
Obedience to the Law of God, imposd
On penaltie of death, and suffering death,
The penaltie to thy transgression due,
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
So onely can high Justice rest appaid.
The Law of God exact he shall fulfill
Both by obedience and by love, though love
Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
To a reproachful life and cursed death,
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
In his redemption, and that his obedience
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
To save them, not thir own, though legal works.
For this he shall live hated, be blasphemd,
Seisd on by force, judgd, and to death condemnd
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,
The Law that is against thee, and the sins
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifid,
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
But soon revives, Death over him no power
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace
By Faith not void of works: this God-like act
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dyd,
In sin for ever lost from life; this act
Shall bruise the head of _Satan_, crush his strength
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
Still followd him; to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learnd
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve
Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
Pure, and in mind prepard, if so befall,
For death, like that which the redeemer dyd.
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
Not onely to the Sons of _Abrahams_ Loines
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons
Of _Abrahams_ Faith wherever through the world;
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.
Then to the Heavn of Heavns he shall ascend
With victory, triumphing through the aire
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines
Through all his realme, & there confounded leave;
Then enter into glory, and resume
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
Above all names in Heavn; and thence shall come,
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
With glory and power to judge both quick & dead,
To judge th unfaithful dead, but to reward
His faithful, and receave them into bliss,
Whether in Heavn or Earth, for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
Then this of _Eden_, and far happier daies.

So spake th Archangel _Michael_, then pausd,
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire
Replete with joy and wonder thus replid.

O goodness infinite, goodness immense!
That all this good of evil shall produce,
And evil turn to good; more wonderful
Then that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,
To God more glory, more good will to Men
From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.
But say, if our deliverer up to Heavn
Must reascend, what will betide the few
His faithful, left among th unfaithful herd,
The enemies of truth; who then shall guide
His people, who defend? will they not deale
Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?

Be sure they will, said th Angel; but from Heavn
Hee to his own a Comforter will send,
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,
To guide them in all truth, and also arme
With spiritual Armour, able to resist
_Satans_ assaults, and quench his fierie darts
What Man can do against them, not affraid,
Though to the death, against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompenct,
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends
To evangelize the Nations, then on all
Baptizd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win
Great numbers of each Nation to receave
With joy the tidings brought from Heavn: at length
Thir Ministry performd, and race well run,
Thir doctrine and thir story written left,
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heavn
To thir own vile advantages shall turne
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint,
Left onely in those written Records pure,
Though not but by the Spirit understood.
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
Places and titles, and with these to joine
Secular power, though feigning still to act
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and givn
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume:
Whence heavie persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes
Religion satisfid; Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,
To good malignant, to bad men benigne,
Under her own waight groaning, till the day
Appeer of respiration to the just,
And vengeance to the wicked, at return
Of him so lately promisd to thy aid,
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
Last in the Clouds from Heavn to be reveald
In glory of the Father, to dissolve
_Satan_ with his perverted World, then raise
From the conflagrant mass, purgd and refind,
New Heavns, new Earth, Ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love,
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.

He ended; and thus _Adam_ last replyd.
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
Measurd this transient World, the Race of time,
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,
And love with feare the onely God, to walk
As in his presence, ever to observe
His providence, and on him sole depend,
Merciful over all his works, with good
Still overcoming evil, and by small
Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victorie,
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.

To whom thus also th Angel last replid:
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs
Thou knewst by name, and all th ethereal Powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heavn, Air, Earth, or Sea,
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
By name to come calld Charitie, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee, happier farr.
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of Speculation; for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect
Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calmd
Portending good, and all her spirits composd
To meek submission: thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
The great deliverance by her Seed to come
(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.
That ye may live, which will be many dayes,
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheerd
With meditation on the happie end.

He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
Descended, _Adam_ to the Bowre where _Eve_
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wakt;
And thus with words not sad she him receavd.

Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee
Art all things under Heavn, all places thou,
VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,
Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,
By mee the Promisd Seed shall all restore.

So spake our Mother _Eve_, and _Adam_ heard
VVell pleasd, but answerd not; for now too nigh
Th Archangel stood, and from the other Hill
To thir fixt Station, all in bright array
The Cherubim descended; on the ground
Gliding meteorous, as Evning Mist
Risn from a River ore the marish glides,
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
Homeward returning.  High in Front advanct,
The brandisht Sword of God before them blazd
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
And vapour as the _Libyan_ Air adust,
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
In either hand the hastning Angel caught
Our lingring Parents, and to th Eastern Gate
Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeerd.
They looking back, all th Eastern side beheld
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,
Wavd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
With dreadful Faces throngd and fierie Armes:
Som natural tears they dropd, but wipd them soon;
The World was all before them, where to choose
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,
Through _Eden_ took thir solitarie way.

  THE END.
