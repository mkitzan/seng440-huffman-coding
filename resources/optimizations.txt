- bit field predicate checks
- constantly allocated huffman tree/dictionary
- level three of tree starts the array to skip traversals to min code length
- register control variables
- array index "pointers" for huffman tree node links
- converted recursive traversal to iterative
- minimized huffman tree/dictionary element data size
