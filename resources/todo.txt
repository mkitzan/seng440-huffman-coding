TODO:
    - Test compression from file for performance stats
	- C level optimizations of encode and decode functions
		- type cast code element down to fit into register
        - experiment with different frequency rounding scheme
        - return in recursive functions within if/else
        - improve predicates
	- ASM level optimizations of encode and decode functions
	- code profile and address bottle neck(s) with hypothetical hardware
	- write report
